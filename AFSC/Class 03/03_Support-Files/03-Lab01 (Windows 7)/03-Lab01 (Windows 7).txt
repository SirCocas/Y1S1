==============================================================
    The following instructions are for the Windows OS
==============================================================

OBJECTIVE
    To create a bootable Mini Windows Forensic Environment (WinFE) CD using a 90-day trial version of Windows 7 and Mini-WinFE Builder.

    - Configure mini-WinFE Builder to create a Mini-WinFE bootable CD
    - Configure the builder to also include FTK Imager
    - Create the ISO and burn it to a CD
    - Boot the laptop using the created CD
    - Use a drive protect, mount and permission change tool to protect the suspect drive
    - Mount the suspect hard drive in read-only mode to view data on it
    - Mount the drive used to store your image
    
    Note: WinFE WinBuilder is no longer available. We need to use Internet Archive to download it.
    
    
BACKGROUND    
    Colin Ramsden (http://www.ramsdens.org.uk/) built a GUI program that would not automatically mount the drives on the computer and would give the Examiner and easy way to mount drives and make them read/write enabled. Without the use of Colin’s script, the drives will automount and the evidence would be compromised. Colin has two scripts – one for the full version of Windows the other is a lite version. The two are NOT interchangeable. Sometime in October 2013, Brett Shaver contacted a user on the WinBuilder website named “misty” who had created MistyPE. MistyPE is a minimalistic 32-bit or 64-bit WinPE/WinFE with a GUI shell called BBLean (based on Blackbox for Windows). Misty was tasked to create a similar minimalistic WinFE builder and Mini-WinFE was created.
