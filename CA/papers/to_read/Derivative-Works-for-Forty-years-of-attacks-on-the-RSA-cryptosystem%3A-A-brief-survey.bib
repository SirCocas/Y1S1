abstract = {Since May (Crypto’02) revealed the vulnerability of the small CRT-exponent RSA using Coppersmith’s lattice-based method, several papers have studied the problem and two major improvements have been made. (1) Bleichenbacher and May (PKC’06) proposed an attack for small $$d_q$$dq when the prime factor p is significantly smaller than the other prime factor q; the attack works for $$p<N^{0.468}$$p<N0.468. (2) Jochemsz and May (Crypto’07) proposed an attack for small $$d_p$$dp and $$d_q$$dq when the prime factors p and q are balanced; the attack works for $$d_p, d_q<N^{0.073}$$dp,dq<N0.073. Even a decade has passed since their proposals, the above two attacks are still considered as the state of the art, and no improvements have been made thus far. A novel technique seems to be required for further improvements since it seems that the attacks have been studied with all the applicable techniques for Coppersmith’s methods proposed by Durfee–Nguyen (Asiacrypt’00), Jochemsz–May (Asiacrypt’06), and Herrmann–May (Asiacrypt’09, PKC’10). Since it seems that the attacks have been studied with all the applicable techniques for Coppersmith’s methods proposed by Durfee–Nguyen (Asiacrypt’00), Jochemsz–May (Asiacrypt’06), and Herrmann–May (Asiacrypt’09, PKC’10), improving the previous results seem technically hard. In this paper, we propose two improved attacks on the small CRT-exponent RSA: a small $$d_q$$dq attack for $$p<N^{0.5}$$p<N0.5 (an improvement of Bleichenbacher–May’s) and a small $$d_p$$dp and $$d_q$$dq attack for $$d_p, d_q < N^{0.122}$$dp,dq<N0.122 (an improvement of Jochemsz–May’s). The latter result is also an improvement of our result in the proceeding version (Eurocrypt ’17); $$d_p, d_q < N^{0.091}$$dp,dq<N0.091. We use Coppersmith’s lattice-based method to solve modular equations and obtain the improvements from a novel lattice construction by exploiting useful algebraic structures of the CRT-RSA key generation equation. We explicitly show proofs of our attacks and verify the validities by computer experiments. In addition to the two main attacks, we also propose small $$d_q$$dq attacks on several variants of RSA.},

abstract = {In 1996, Coppersmith proposed a lattice-based method to solve the small roots of a univariate modular equation in polynomial time. Since its invention, Coppersmith’s method has become an important tool in the cryptanalysis of RSA crypto algorithm and its variants. In 2006, Jochemsz and May introduced a general strategy to solve small roots of any form of multivariate modular equations in polynomial time. Based on Jochemsz–May’s strategy, for any given multivariate equations one can easily construct the desired lattices with triangular matrix basis. However, for some attacks, Jochemsz–May’s general strategy could not fully capture the algebraic structure of the target polynomials. Thus, some sophisticated techniques that can deeply exploit the algebraic relations have been proposed. In this paper, we give a survey of these recent approaches for lattice constructions, and also give small examples to show how these approaches work.},

abstract = {Abstract Partial key exposure attacks on RSA have been intensively studied by using lattice-based Coppersmith's methods. Ernst et al. (Eurocrypt'05) studied the problem by considering three attack scenarios; (1) the most significant bits (MSBs) of a secret exponent d known, (2) the least significant bits (LSBs) of d known, (3) both the MSBs and the LSBs of d known. The proposed attacks were valuable since they were the first results to handle full size exponents e. Takayasu and Kunihiro (SAC'14, Theoretical Computer Science'19) proposed improved attacks for (1) and (2) when d is sufficiently small, i.e., d N 0.5625 for (1) and d N 0.368 for (2), by utilizing a linearization technique. In this paper, we extend Takayasu-Kunihiro's attacks and improve Ernst et al.'s attack for (3). In particular, our attack contains Takayasu-Kunihiro's attacks for (1) and (2) as special cases when the amount of given LSBs and MSBs are zero, respectively. Furthermore, as opposed to Takayasu-Kunihiro's attacks, our improvement against Ernst et al.'s attack is not limited to small secret exponents such as d N 0.5625 . Indeed, we are able to improve Ernst et al.'s attack almost up to full size decryption exponents, i.e., even when d is close to N. Technically, the extension is not straightforward. We first modify Takayasu-Kunihiro's lattice basis matrix for (2), so that is is compatible to embed the given MSBs. The modification is crucial for embedding both the MSBs and the LSBs simultaneously to the matrix.},

abstract = {Abstract Thus far, several lattice-based algorithms for partial key exposure attacks on RSA, i.e., given the most/least significant bits (MSBs/LSBs) of a secret exponent d and factoring an RSA modulus N, have been proposed such as Blomer and May (Crypto'03), Ernst et al. (Eurocrypt'05), and Aono (PKC'09). Due to Boneh and Durfee's small secret exponent attack, partial key exposure attacks should always work for d N 0.292 even without any partial information. However, it was difficult task to make use of the given partial information without losing the quality of Boneh–Durfee's attack. In particular, known partial key exposure attacks fail to work for d N 0.292 with only few partial information. Such unnatural situation stems from the fact that the additional information makes underlying modular equations involved. In this paper, we propose improved attacks when a secret exponent d is small. Our attacks are better than all known previous attacks in the sense that our attacks require less partial information. Specifically, our attack is better than all known ones for d N 0.5625 and d N 0.368 with the MSBs and the LSBs, respectively. Furthermore, our attacks fully cover the Boneh–Durfee bound, i.e., they always work for d N 0.292 . At a high level, we obtain the improved attacks by fully utilizing unraveled linearization technique proposed by Herrmann and May (Asiacrypt'09). Although Herrmann and May (PKC'10) already applied the technique to Boneh–Durfee's attack, we show elegant and impressive extensions to capture partial key exposure attacks. More concretely, we construct structured triangular matrices that enable us to recover more useful algebraic structures of underlying modular polynomials. We embed the given MSBs/LSBs to the recovered algebraic structures and construct our partial key exposure attacks. In this full version, we provide overviews and explicit proofs of the triangular matrix constructions. We believe that the additional explanations help readers to understand our techniques.},

abstract = {Several algorithms have been proposed for factoring RSA modulus \(N\) when attackers know the most or the least significant \((\beta -\delta )\log N\) bits of secret exponents \(d<N^{\beta }\). The attacks are expected to work when \( \beta <1-1/\sqrt{2}\) with full size public exponent \(e\) considering Boneh and Durfee’s result for small secret exponent attacks on RSA. However, previous attacks do not always work in this condition when attackers know only a small amount of information on secret exponent, that is, \( \delta \) is close to \( \beta \). In this paper, we propose the improved algorithms for partial key exposure attacks which cover Boneh and Durfee’s bound when \( \delta =\beta \). Our algorithms are the best among all known results when attackers know the most significant bits of \(d \le N^{9/16}\) or the least significant bits of \(d \le N^{(9-\sqrt{21})/12}\). In our algorithm constructions, we construct basis matrices for lattices which are not triangular and analyze the determinant by using unravelled linearization. The analysis enables us to make better use of the algebraic structures of modular polynomials, that is, we can select appropriate lattice bases or construct appropriate lattice bases.},

abstract = {Thus far, partial key exposure attacks on RSA have been intensively studied using lattice based Coppersmith’s methods. In the context, attackers are given partial information of a secret exponent and prime factors of (Multi-Prime) RSA where the partial information is exposed in various ways. Although these attack scenarios are worth studying, there are several known attacks whose constructions have similar flavor. In this paper, we try to formulate general attack scenarios to capture several existing ones and propose attacks for the scenarios. Our attacks contain all the state-of-the-art partial key exposure attacks, e.g., due to Ernst et al. (Eurocrypt’05) and Takayasu-Kunihiro (SAC’14, ICISC’14), as special cases. As a result, our attacks offer better results than previous best attacks in some special cases, e.g., Sarkar-Maitra’s partial key exposure attacks on RSA with the most significant bits of a prime factor (ICISC’08) and Hinek’s partial key exposure attacks on Multi-Prime RSA (J. Math. Cryptology ’08). We claim that our contribution is not only generalizations or improvements of the existing results. Since our attacks capture general exposure scenarios, the results can be used as a tool kit; the security of some future variants of RSA can be examined without any knowledge of Coppersmith’s methods.},

abstract = {Abstract There have been several works for studying the security of CRT-RSA with small CRT exponents d p and d q by using lattice-based Coppersmith's method. Thus far, two attack scenarios have been mainly studied: (1) d q is small with unbalanced prime factors p ≪ q . (2) Both d p and d q are small for balanced p ≈ q . The best attacks for the both scenarios were proposed by Takayasu-Lu-Peng (Eurocrypt'17, Journal of Cryptology'19) and the attack conditions are much better than the other known attacks. Although the attacks have been very useful for studying the security of CRT-RSA, the structures of their proposed lattices are not well understood. In this paper, to further study the security of CRT-RSA, we first define a generalized attack scenario to unify the previous ones. Specifically, all p , q , d p , and d q can be of arbitrary sizes. Furthermore, we propose improved attacks in this paper when d p and/or p is sufficiently small. Technically, we construct a lattice whose basis vectors are chosen flexibly depending on the sizes of p , q , d p , and d q . Since the attack scenarios (1) and (2) are simpler than our general scenario, the previous Takayasu-Lu-Peng's lattices are simple special cases of ours. We are able to achieve the flexible lattice constructions by exploiting implicit but essential structures of Takayasu-Lu-Peng's lattices. We check the validity of our proposed attacks by computer experiments. We believe that the deeper understanding of the lattice structures will be useful for studying the security of CRT-RSA even in other scenarios.},

abstract = {Boneh and Durfee (Eurocrypt 1999) proposed two polynomial time attacks on small secret exponent RSA. The first attack works when d < N0.284 whereas the second attack works when d < N0.292. Both attacks are based on lattice based Coppersmith's method to solve modular equations. Durfee and Nguyen (Asiacrypt 2000) extended the attack to a variant of RSA where prime factors are not the same sizes. However, the attack extended only the first attack of the Boneh-Durfee. Hence, an open problem remains, i.e., if the Boneh-Durfee second attack can be extended to unbalanced RSA. In this paper, we propose a desired attack that extended the Boneh-Durfee second attack. Our proposed attack fully improves the Durfee-Nguyen attack for all size of prime factors. The improvement stems from our technical lattice construction. Although Durfee and Nguyen only analyzed lattices whose basis matrices are triangular, we analyze broader classes of lattices that contain non-triangular basis matrices. The analysis can be performed by using the unravelled linearization proposed by Herrmann and May (Asiacrypt 2009) and the transformation on the Boneh-Durfee lattices proposed by Takayasu and Kunihiro (PKC 2016). As a result, we can exploit useful algebraic structure compared with the Durfee-Nguyen.},
