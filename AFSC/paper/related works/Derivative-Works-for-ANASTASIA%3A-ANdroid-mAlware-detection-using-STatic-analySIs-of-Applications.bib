abstract = {Android applications are developing rapidly across the mobile ecosystem, but Android malware is also emerging in an endless stream. Many researchers have studied the problem of Android malware detection and have put forward theories and methods from different perspectives. Existing research suggests that machine learning is an effective and promising way to detect Android malware. Notwithstanding, there exist reviews that have surveyed different issues related to Android malware detection based on machine learning. We believe our work complements the previous reviews by surveying a wider range of aspects of the topic. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Android malware detection approaches based on machine learning. We briefly introduce some background on Android applications, including the Android system architecture, security mechanisms, and classification of Android malware. Then, taking machine learning as the focus, we analyze and summarize the research status from key perspectives such as sample acquisition, data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning models, algorithms, and the evaluation of detection effectiveness. Finally, we assess the future prospects for research into Android malware detection based on machine learning. This review will help academics gain a full picture of Android malware detection based on machine learning. It could then serve as a basis for subsequent researchers to start new work and help to guide research in the field more generally.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Android-based smartphones made it an important target for malicious applications’ developers. So, a large number of frameworks have been proposed to tackle the huge number of daily published malwares. Despite there are many review papers that have been conducted in order to shed light on the works that achieved in Android malware analysing domain, the number of conducted review papers do not fit with the importance of this research field and with the volume of achieved works. Also, there is no comprehensive taxonomy for all research trends in the field of analysing malicious applications targeting the Android system. Furthermore, none of the existing review papers contains a schematic model that makes it easy for the reader to know the methods and methodologies used in a particular field of research without much effort. This paper aims at proposing a comprehensive taxonomy and suggesting a new schematic review approach. To this end, a review of a large number of works that achieved between 2009 and 2019 has been conducted. The achieved study includes more than 200 papers that have different goals such as apps’ behaviour analysis, automatic user interface triggers or packer/unpacker frameworks development. Also, a comprehensive taxonomy has been proposed so that most of the previous works can be classified under it. To the best of our knowledge, the suggested taxonomy is the widest and the most comprehensive in terms of the covered research trends. Moreover, we have proposed a detailed schematic model (called Schematic Review Model) illustrates the process of detecting the malignant applications of an Android in the light of the studied works and the proposed taxonomy. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the Android malware detection methods have been explained in this way with this amount of detail. Furthermore, the studied researches have been analysed according to multiple criteria such as used analysing method, used features, used detection method, and used dataset. Also, the features used in the studied works were discussed in detail by dividing it into multiple classes. Moreover, the challenges facing Android’s malware analysing methods were discussed in detail. Finally, it has been concluded that there are gaps between the size and the goal of the conducted works and the number of malicious apps published every day, so some future works areas have been proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {The number of applications (apps) available for smart devices or Android based IoT (Internet of Things) has surged dramatically over the past few years. Meanwhile, the volume of ill-designed or malicious apps (malapps) has been growing explosively. To ensure the quality and security of the apps in the markets, many approaches have been proposed in recent years to discriminate malapps from benign ones. Machine learning is usually utilized in classification process. Accurately characterizing apps’ behaviors, or so-called features, directly affects the detection results with machine learning algorithms. Android apps evolve very fast. The size of current apps has become increasingly large and the behaviors of apps have become increasingly complicated. The extracting effective and representative features from apps is thus an ongoing challenge. Although many types of features have been extracted in existing work, to the best of our knowledge, no work has systematically surveyed the features constructed for detecting Android malapps. In this paper, we are motivated to provide a clear and comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art work that detects malapps by characterizing behaviors of apps with various types of features. Through the designed criteria, we collect a total of 1947 papers in which 236 papers are used for the survey with four dimensions: the features extracted, the feature selection methods employed if any, the detection methods used, and the scale of evaluation performed. Based on our in-depth survey, we highlight the issues of exploring effective features from apps, provide the taxonomy of these features and indicate the future directions.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is revolutionizing this world with its evolving applications in various aspects of life such as sensing, healthcare, remote monitoring, and so on. Android devices and applications are working hand to hand to realize dreams of the IoT. Recently, there is a rapid increase in threats and malware attacks on Android-based devices. Moreover, due to extensive exploitation of the Android platform in the IoT devices creates a task challenging of securing such kind of malware activities. This paper presents a novel framework that combines the advantages of both machine learning techniques and blockchain technology to improve the malware detection for Android IoT devices. The proposed technique is implemented using a sequential approach, which includes clustering, classification, and blockchain. Machine learning automatically extracts the malware information using clustering and classification technique and store the information into the blockchain. Thereby, all malware information stored in the blockchain history can be communicated through the network, and therefore any latest malware can be detected effectively. The implementation of the clustering technique includes calculation of weights for each feature set, the development of parametric study for optimization and simultaneously iterative reduction of unnecessary features having small weights. The classification algorithm is implemented to extract the various features of Android malware using naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, the naive Bayes classifier is based on decision trees for extracting more important features to provide classification and regression for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Finally, our proposed framework uses the permissioned blockchain to store authentic information of extracted features in a distributed malware database blocks to increase the run-time detection of malware with more speed and accuracy, and further to announce malware information for all users.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) is a disruptive technology that has changed the landscape of cyber security research. Deep learning models have many advantages over traditional Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly when there is a large amount of data available. Android malware detection or classification qualifies as a big data problem because of the fast booming number of Android malware, the obfuscation of Android malware, and the potential protection of huge values of data assets stored on the Android devices. It seems a natural choice to apply DL on Android malware detection. However, there exist challenges for researchers and practitioners, such as choice of DL architecture, feature extraction and processing, performance evaluation, and even gathering adequate data of high quality. In this survey, we aim to address the challenges by systematically reviewing the latest progress in DL-based Android malware detection and classification. We organize the literature according to the DL architecture, including FCN, CNN, RNN, DBN, AE, and hybrid models. The goal is to reveal the research frontier, with the focus on representing code semantics for Android malware detection. We also discuss the challenges in this emerging field and provide our view of future research opportunities and directions.},

abstract = {Malicious applications (especially in the Android platform) are a serious threat to developers and end-users. Many research efforts have hence been devoted to developing effective approaches to defend Android malware. However, with the explosive growth of Android malware and the continuous advancement of malicious evasion technologies like obfuscation and reflection, android malware defenses based on manual rules or traditional machine learning may not be effective due to limited apriori knowledge. In recent years, a dominant research field of deep learning (DL) with the powerful feature abstraction ability has demonstrated a compelling and promising performance in various fields, like Nature Language processing and image processing. To this end, employing deep learning techniques to thwart the attack of Android malware has recently gained considerable research attention. Yet, there exists no systematic literature review that focuses on deep learning approaches for Android Malware defenses. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 104 studies were identified over the period 2014-2020. The results of our investigation show that even though most of these studies still mainly consider DL-based on Android malware detection, 35 primary studies (33.7%) design the defenses approaches based on other scenarios. This review also describes research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.},

abstract = {With the growing era of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices are connecting with the Internet using android applications to provide various services. The IoT devices are used for sensing, controlling and monitoring of different processes. Most of IoT devices use Android applications for communication and data exchange. Therefore, a secure Android permission privileged mechanism is required to increase the security of apps. According to a recent study, a malicious Android application is developed almost every 10 s. To resist this serious malware campaign, we need effective malware detection approaches to identify malware applications effectively and efficiently. Most of the studies focused on detecting malware based on static and dynamic analysis of the applications. However, to analyse the risky permission at runtime is a challenging task. In this study, first, we proposed a novel approach to distinguish between malware and benign applications based on permission ranking, similarity-based permission feature selection, and association rule for permission mining. Secondly, the proposed methodology also includes the enhancement of the random forest algorithm to improve the accuracy for malware detection. The experimental outcomes demonstrate high proficiency of the accuracy for malware detection, which is pivotal for android apps aiming for secure data exchange between IoT devices.},

abstract = {Nowadays with the development of smartphone and its operating system, such as Android, the amount of mobile malware is correspondingly increasing. To protect the privacy security of both users and manufacturers, Android malware detection has received a lot of research focuses. Traditional methods mainly rely on static analysis or dynamic monitoring, which is either software sensitive or time-consuming. Recently, with the development of machine learning and deep learning techniques, many efforts introduced such learning-based techniques into the Android malware detection and achieved promising detection results as well as substantially reduced time costing. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of a comprehensive summary at the deep learning technical level for these learning-based malware detection works. As a result, it is limited to improve the detection technique referring to existing works from a global map. To address the challenge, in this paper, we systematically study existing deep learning-based malware detection works and classify them from the technique perspective. We also conclude the advantages and threats within each category of detection technique and provide a concrete technical reference for future improvement work.},
