abstract = {In order to ensure trusted in---field operation of integrated circuits, it is important to develop efficient low---cost techniques to detect malicious tampering (also referred to as Hardware Trojan ) that causes undesired change in functional behavior. Conventional post--- manufacturing testing, test generation algorithms and test coverage metrics cannot be readily extended to hardware Trojan detection. In this paper, we propose a test pattern generation technique based on multiple excitation of rare logic conditions at internal nodes. Such a statistical approach maximizes the probability of inserted Trojans getting triggered and detected by logic testing, while drastically reducing the number of vectors compared to a weighted random pattern based test generation. Moreover, the proposed test generation approach can be effective towards increasing the sensitivity of Trojan detection in existing side---channel approaches that monitor the impact of a Trojan circuit on power or current signature. Simulation results for a set of ISCAS benchmarks show that the proposed test generation approach can achieve comparable or better Trojan detection coverage with about 85% reduction in test length on average over random patterns.},

abstract = {Hardware manufacturers are increasingly outsourcing their IC fabrication work overseas due to their much lower cost structure. This poses a significant security risk for ICs used for critical military and business applications. Attackers can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique borrowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mitigate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to construct a set of fingerprints/or an IC family utilizing side- channel information such as power, temperature, and electromagnetic (EM) profiles. The set of fingerprints can be developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were all authentic. The remaining ICs are verified using statistical tests against the fingerprints. We describe the theoretical framework and present preliminary experimental results to show that this approach is viable by presenting results obtained by using power simulations performed on representative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These results show that Trojans that are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal processing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds of millions of transistors would require certain modifications to the IC design process, our results provide a starting point to address this important problem.},

abstract = {Malicious modification of integrated circuits (ICs) in untrusted foundry, referred to as "Hardware Trojan", has emerged as a serious security threat. While side-channel analysis has been reported as an effective approach to detect hardware Trojans, increasing process variations in nanoscale technologies pose a major challenge, since process noise can easily mask the Trojan effect on a measured side-channel parameter, such as supply current. Besides, existing side-channel approaches suffer from reduced Trojan detection sensitivity with increasing design size. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable side-channel approach, named self-referencing, along with associated vector generation algorithm to improve the Hardware Trojan detection sensitivity under large process variations. It compares transient current signature of one region of an IC with that of another, thereby nullifying the effect of process noise by exploiting spatial correlation across regions in terms of process variations. To amplify the Trojan effect on supply current, we propose a region-based vector generation approach, which divides a circuit-undertest (CUT) into several regions and for each region, finds the test vectors which induce maximum activity in that region, while minimizing the activity in other regions. We show that the proposed side-channel approach is scalable with respect to both amount of process variations and design size. The approach is validated with both simulation and measurement results using an FPGA-based test setup for large designs including a 32-bit DLX processor core (∼ 105 transistors). Results shows that our approach can find ultra-small (<0.01% area) Trojans under large process variations of up to ± 20% shift in transistor threshold voltage.},

abstract = {Trusted IC design is a recently emerged topic since fabrication factories are moving worldwide in order to reduce cost. In order to get a low-cost but effective hardware trojan detection method to complement traditional testing methods, a new behavior-oriented category method is proposed to divide trojans into two categories: explicit payload trojan and implicit payload trojan. This categorization method makes it possible to construct trojan models and then lower the cost of testing. Path delays of nominal chips are collected to construct a series of fingerprints, each one representing one aspect of the total characteristics of a genuine design. Chips are validated by comparing their delay parameters to the fingerprints. The comparison of path delays makes small trojan circuits significant from a delay point of view. The experimentpsilas results show that the detection rate on explicit payload trojans is 100%, while this method should be developed further if used to detect implicit payload trojans.},

abstract = {Malicious alterations of integrated circuits during fabrication in untrusted foundries pose major concern in terms of their reliable and trusted field operation. It is extremely difficult to discover such alterations, also referred to as “hardware Trojans” using conventional structural or functional testing strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel non-invasive, multiple-parameter side-channel analysis based Trojan detection approach that is capable of detecting malicious hardware modifications in the presence of large process variation induced noise. We exploit the intrinsic relationship between dynamic current (IDDT ) and maximum operating frequency (Fmax) of a circuit to distinguish the effect of a Trojan from process induced fluctuations in IDDT . We propose a vector generation approach for IDDT measurement that can improve the Trojan detection sensitivity for arbitrary Trojan instances. Simulation results with two large circuits, a 32-bit integer execution unit (IEU) and a 128-bit Advanced Encryption System (AES) cipher, show a detection resolution of 0.04% can be achieved in presence of ±20% parameter (Vth) variations. The approach is also validated with experimental results using 120nm FPGA (Xilinx Virtex-II) chips.},

abstract = {Trust in reference to integrated circuits addresses the concern that the design and/or fabrication of the integrated circuit (IC) may be purposely altered by an adversary. The insertion of a hardware Trojan involves a deliberate and malicious change to an IC that adds or removes functionality or reduces its reliability. Trojans are designed to disable and/or destroy the IC at some future time or they may serve to leak confidential information covertly to the adversary. Trojans can be cleverly hidden by the adversary to make it extremely difficult for chip validation processes, such as manufacturing test, to accidentally discover them. This paper investigates the sensitivity of a power supply transient signal analysis method for detecting Trojans. In particular, we focus on determining the smallest detectable Trojan, i.e., the least number of gates a Trojan may have and still be detected, using a set of process simulation models that characterize a TSMC 0.18 μm process. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our Trojan detection method in the presence of measurement noise and background switching activity.},

abstract = {Security of a computer system has been traditionally related to the security of the software or the information being processed. The underlying hardware used for information processing has been considered trusted. The emergence of hardware Trojan attacks violates this root of trust. These attacks, in the form of malicious modifications of electronic hardware at different stages of its life cycle, pose major security concerns in the electronics industry. An adversary can mount such an attack with an objective to cause operational failure or to leak secret information from inside a chip-e.g., the key in a cryptographic chip, during field operation. Global economic trend that encourages increased reliance on untrusted entities in the hardware design and fabrication process is rapidly enhancing the vulnerability to such attacks. In this paper, we analyze the threat of hardware Trojan attacks; present attack models, types, and scenarios; discuss different forms of protection approaches, both proactive and reactive; and describe emerging attack modes, defenses, and future research pathways.},

In this work, we propose a circuit partition based approach to detect and locate the embedded Trojan. Results show that our approach is effective in separating out candidate Trojans in the circuit. In addition, we provide a power profile based method for refining the candidate regions that may contain a Trojan. In many cases, such an isolation method leads to noticeable manifestation of the anomalous behavior of the circuit due to the presence of the Trojan thereby enhancing chances of their detection.},
