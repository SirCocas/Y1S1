abstract = {With the application of integrated circuits (ICs) appears in all aspects of life, whether an IC is security and reliable has caused increasing worry which is of significant necessity. An attacker can achieve the malicious purpose by adding or removing some modules, so called hardware Trojans (HTs). In this paper, we use side-channel analysis (SCA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether there is a Trojan in the circuit. We use SAKURA-G circuit board with Xilinx SPARTAN-6 to complete our experiment. Results show that the Trojan detection rate is up to 93% and the classification accuracy is up to 91.8475%.},

abstract = {It has been observed very critically in the hardware that robust Trojans are inserted in outsourced products resulting in security vulnerabilities. It is more important to note that some areas are in need to be more reliable and trust worthy with respect to security. A perpetrator in any possible location could alter the circuit behavior by including an unintended module in the circuit which can be very hard or impossible to detect until triggered. In this paper, a self-referencing approach is proposed that measures the leakage power of the circuit at different time windows. This approach can efficiently and reliably detect the leakage power that the Trojan creates and also avoids the requirement of golden chip by mapping a chip’s leakage power at different time window. The proposed method is also formulated using compressive sensing algorithm for selecting Trojan revealing test vectors and compresses the chip output. The proposed method is validated on ISCAS’85 benchmark circuits, in which 82% reduction in the output dimensions for the leakage power measurement is achieved for a compression ratio of 0.75.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojan detection plays a significant role in building a trusted integrated circuit (IC) industry. Unfortunately, the conventional Trojan detection techniques may fail when the feature of the embedded Trojan is masked by the feature of the random side-channel leakages. To overcome the constraint, in this Letter, a novel machine learning technique based on residual neural networks (ResNet) is proposed to classify the different features to achieve the Trojan detection. In the proposed Trojan detection methodology, two different Trojan-free IC chips are used for training the ResNet to study the feature of the random side-channel leakages. Subsequently, a suspected IC chip is tested by the well-trained ResNet to infer whether the feature associated with the suspected IC chip is caused by the random side-channel leakages or the embedded Trojan. As demonstrated in the result, after enabling about 250,000 data to train the ResNet, the hardware Trojan can be detected by using the proposed methodology.},

In this paper, a key leakage Trojan circuit was designed and the original circuit was SM4, a Chinese block cipher algorithm standard. The trigger part is composed of sequential and combinational circuits, so the hardware Trojan would be triggered only when the conditions are met for both two kinds of circuits. One of its components is a counter, with timing function if necessary. The scheme was verified on a DE2-115 Altera cyclone-IV FPGA board. And the total registers increasing caused by the hardware Trojan is as low as 0.26%.},

abstract = {Malicious modification of integrated circuits in untrusted design house or foundry has emerged as a major security threat. Such modifications, popularly referred to as Hardware Trojans, are difficult to detect during manufacturing test. Sequential hardware Trojans, usually triggered by a sequence of rare events, represent a common and deadly form of Trojans that can be extremely hard to detect using logic testing approaches. Side-channel analysis has emerged as an effective approach for detection of hardware Trojans. However, existing side-channel approaches suffer from increasing process variations, which largely reduce the detection sensitivity and sets a lower limit of the sizes of Trojans detectable. In this paper, we present TeSR, a Temporal Self-Referencing approach that compares the current signature of a chip at two different time windows to isolate the Trojan effect. Since it uses a chip as a reference to itself, the method completely eliminates the effect of process noise and other design marginalities (e.g. capacitive coupling), thus providing high detection sensitivity for Trojans of varying size. Furthermore, unlike most of the existing approaches, TeSR does not require a golden reference chip instance, which may impose a major limitation. Associated test generation, test application, and signature comparison approaches aimed at maximizing Trojan detection sensitivity are also presented. Simulation results for three complex sequential designs and three representative sequential Trojan circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach under large inter- and intra-die process variations. The approach is also validated with current measurement results from several Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA chips.},

abstract = {Hardware security has recently become a research hotspot due to the separating trend of integrated circuit design and manufacturing in the global industry chain. Among all security threats, the hardware trojan (HT) inserted into the integrated circuit is one of the most concerns. As a flexible and nondestructive approach, the side-channel analysis techniques are widely used for HT detection. However, noise sensitivity and golden chip dependence make side-channel based approaches face greatly challenge in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection approach based on Isolation Forest, which provides high precision detection capability, while reducing the dependence of the golden chip. First, we perform special preprocessing, named Main Difference Accumulation (MDA), on the side-channel information to magnify the impacts of HT. Then, we train the isolation forest model using the processed information. During the test phase, the obtained model can score the test data. Finally, we complete the detection of HT based on the score and threshold. Moreover, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the automatic selection of the threshold in the isolation forest. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, we select the power signal as the side-channel information and insert four different kinds of HTs into the AES-128 crypto core. Results obtained using a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA board show that the accuracy of HT detection can reach 100%, with a 1.13% relative area ratio of the original circuit.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Hardware Trojan threats have become inevitable due to the growing complexities of Integrated Circuits (ICs) as well as the current trend of Intellectual Property (IP)-based hardware designs. An adversary can insert a Hardware Trojan during any of its life cycle phases — the design, fabrication or even at manufacturing phase. Once a Trojan is inserted into a system, it can cause an unwanted modification to system functionality which may degrade system performance or sometimes Trojans are implanted with the target to leak secret information. Once Trojans are implanted, they are hard to detect and impossible to remove from the system as they are already fabricated into the chip. In this paper, we propose three stealthy Trojan models which affect the coherence mechanism of Chip Multiprocessors’ (CMPs) cache system by arbitrarily modifying the cache block state which in turn may leave the cache line states as incoherent. We have evaluated the payload of such modeled Trojans and proposed a cellular automaton (CA)-based solution for detection of such Trojans.},

One is a real-time based Trojan, which will attack a system at some specific realworld time. The other is a relative-time based Trojan, which will be triggered when a specific time period passes after the system is powered on. In either case when a Trojan is triggered its payload may corrupt the system or leakage internal information to the outside world. Experimental results show that the extra power consumption, area overhead and delay time are all quite small and thus the detection of the Trojans is difficult by using traditional side-channel detection methods.},

Azaazulenes are a class of the compounds that have been receiving attention for their relationship with the chemistry of azulenes and for remarkable characters about physical and chemical properties as well as biological activities. After being previously reviewed last year, many significant researches were developed in this field, especially, polycyclic and /or polyaza-compounds containing azaazulene skeleton, such as pyrrolobenzazepines, azepinoindole derivatives, and so on, were directed attention from their biological activities and potentialities of drug use. As a consequence, some reviews appeared about the synthesis for 3,4-fused tricyclic indoles, 1,7-fused tricyclic indoles, azepinoindole alkaloids, and cyclo[b]fused indoles, and construction of seven-membered ring. This review covers the recent progress in the chemistry of azaazulenes including some of their dihydro-, tetrahydro-, oxo-derivatives and aromatics-fused derivatives and related compounds such as pyrrolobenzazepines, and azepinoindole derivatives published from end of 2017 to April 2019. --------------------------------------------------------------------Dedicated to Prof. Dr. Kaoru Fuji on the occasion of his 80th birthday. I. SYNTHESES OF AZAAZULENES For construction of azaazulene skeletons, cyclization strategies are frequently used and conspicuous methods. Cycloaddition reactions are the important tools for synthesis of the complex cyclic skeletons. Annulation of seven-membered ring onto pyrrole, diazole, triazole or indole rings are frequently used synthetic methodology. As building blocks, alkynylcompounds, such as skipped diynes (1,4-diynes), propargyl derivatives, and arylacetylenes, have been used extensively. Among cycloadditions, the [5+2]cycloaddition is an excellent method for construct seven-membered ring systems. The [3+2+2]cycloaddition is also important synthetic tool for the functionalized seven-membered ring systems. Varieties of transition metals such as Ni, In, Rh, Pd, Co, Au, or Ru were used as catalyst for various cycloadditions. Recently, an interesting review about palladium-catalyzed cascade cyclization appeared. Mechanistic elucidations of [Rh(NHC)]-catalyzed intramolecular [5+2]cycloaddition of vinyloxiranes and vinylcyclopropanes by DFT calculations with alkynes were carried out. Unprecedented Pd-catalyzed highly regioand chemoselective alkyne insertion/cyclization of the C2-H bond with o-indoloanilines was reported (Scheme 1).},

abstract = {This study applies the X-ray Laminography technique to inspect printed circuit boards. The objective is to study effects of some system parameters on the reconstruction quality. The system parameters studied include the kinematical type of the system, the number of synthesized images and the projection angle. The simulation results show that when the translation type is adopted, the translation direction of the X-ray source should not parallel to the major wire direction on other planes. In other words, the direction of wire has to be specified for generating good results when using the translation type. When the rotation type is adopted, the effect of wire orientation on reconstructed image is less significant. The image quality is generally improved by increasing the number of the synthesized images. However, the improvement is less significant when the image number increased. For example, the difference for image reconstructed from 32 frames and 16 frames is less than 1% for the case examined.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous multicore processors integrate CPU and GPU cores which use a common last-level cache (LLC). However, it puts more pressure on cache management algorithm. Since GPU cores have higher number of threads, most of the LLC space will be dominated by GPU application, leaving limited space for CPU application. Because of this reason, it seriously affects the overall system performance. Aiming at the unfair utilization of GPU and CPU cores for shared cache resource, this paper mainly proposes a novel cache management method: cache partition combined with the adaptive replacement policy. We first split the cache capacity to adjust the ratio of CPU and GPU cores for shared LLC resource and then use adaptive replacement policies for CPU and GPU applications to access LLC. Experimental results show that our scheme can make GPU applications in the case of minimal loss of performance, improve the performance of CPU applications by 16% on average (up to 33%), the overall performance improved by 6 %( up to 19%).},

abstract = {As the opportunities for the need of electronics to work reliably and safely in automotive environments continue to develop and become more important within a wide variety of market applications, the role of test and inspection to probe the quality of these new devices before active use becomes ever more important. For automotive environment applications there is a need to inspect non-destructively for the presence of voids, whether that be within a package, on the board or at other interfacial bonding layers. This is because thermal and power performance may be compromised if voids occur and voiding may be a key identifier for the subsequent strength and stability of these devices and their ultimate performance. The use of X-ray technology to investigate electronics used in automotive environments allows true non-destructive analysis for the presence of voiding. This often enables the root cause of issues to be quickly investigated without the need to cut or destroy the sample, an act which may otherwise potentially mask the real situation. The presence, quantity and location of voids can be clearly seen and measured in the X-ray results. This paper will explain the recent developments that have been made in 2D, 2.5D and 3D X-ray inspection and how they can be applied to electronics for automotive environments. The developments to be discussed will include the use of partial computer tomography (PCT), sometimes also called laminography, as well as the use of new ‘full CT’ algorithms, such as helical CT, which improve the clarity of the necessary analysis and clearly locate the source of potential voiding problems.},

To prevent the loss of oxygen by the exhaust, the cathode gas can be fed back by cathode gas recirculation while oxygen is injected. Thereby the opportunity to feed back the humidity of the exhaust air for additional fuel cell humidification becomes available. 
The humidification of a PEFC is essential to ensure high protonic conductivity and reduce voltage losses. However, the water content of the inlet gas has to be regulated to prevent the electrodes from flooding. To control the humidity of the system the gas flow rate, the temperature of the fuel cell and the cathode gas can be adjusted. In addition, the enhanced water content in the system allows increasing the operating temperatures. 
This work focuses on experimental study of a 12 kW PEFC-System with cathode gas recirculation and a phenomenological model to optimize the fuel cell humidification depending on the operating parameters.},

abstract = {Government agencies and the semiconductor industry have raised serious concerns about malicious modifications to the integrated circuits. The added functionality known as hardware Trojan poses major detection and isolation challenges. This paper presents a new hardware trust architecture to magnify functional Trojans activity. Trojan detection resolution depends on Trojan activity directly and circuit activity reversely. The proposed architecture reorders scan cells based on their placement during physical design to reduce circuit switching activity by limiting it into a specific region. This helps magnify Trojan contribution to the total circuit transient power by increasing Trojan-to-circuit switching activity (TCA) and Trojan-to-circuit power consumption (TCP). The proposed technique aims to improve the efficiency of power-based side-channel signal analysis techniques for detecting hardware Trojans. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the method in significantly increasing TCA and TCP.},

abstract = {Malicious modification of integrated circuits, referred to as Hardware Trojans, in untrusted fabrication facility has emerged as a major security threat. Logic testing approaches are not very effective for detecting large sequential Trojans which require multiple state transitions often triggered by rare circuit events in order to activate and cause malfunction. On the other hand, side-channel analysis has emerged as an effective approach for detection of such large sequential Trojans. However, existing side-channel approaches suffer from large reduction in detection sensitivity with increasing process variations or decreasing Trojan size. In this paper, we propose TeSR, a Temporal Self-Referencing approach that compares the current signature of a chip at two different time windows to completely eliminate the effect of process noise, thus providing high detection sensitivity for Trojans of varying size. Furthermore, unlike existing approaches, it does not require golden chip instances as a reference. Simulation results for three complex designs and three representative sequential Trojan circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach under large inter- and intra-die process variations.},

The prototypes of HTs that can be detected are modelled in a library by using Control-Flow Graphs (CFGs) that can be parametrised and extended to cover several variants of Trojan patterns. Experimental results show that our approach is effective and efficient in comparison with other state-of-the-art solutions.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojan attack in the form of malicious modification of a design has emerged as a major security threat. Sidechannel analysis has been investigated as an alternative to conventional logic testing to detect the presence of hardware Trojans. However, these techniques suffer from decreased sensitivity toward small Trojans, especially because of the large process variations present in modern nanometer technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel noninvasive, multiple-parameter side-channel analysisbased Trojan detection approach. We use the intrinsic relationship between dynamic current and maximum operating frequency of a circuit to isolate the effect of a Trojan circuit from process noise. We propose a vector generation approach and several design/test techniques to improve the detection sensitivity. Simulation results with two large circuits, a 32-bit integer execution unit (IEU) and a 128-bit advanced encryption standard (AES) cipher, show a detection resolution of 1.12 percent amidst ±20 percent parameter variations. The approach is also validated with experimental results. Finally, the use of a combined side-channel analysis and logic testing approach is shown to provide high overall detection coverage for hardware Trojan circuits of varying types and sizes.},

The reason being that these techniques consider the HT landscape to be limited only to the publicly known HT benchmarks. However the adversary is not limited to these HTs and may devise new HT design principles to bypass these countermeasures. In this paper, we discover certain crucial properties of trigger activated HTs which lead to the definition of an exponentially large class of Deterministic Hardware Trojans HD that an adversary can (but is not limited to) design. The discovered properties serve as HT design principles which help us understand the tremendous ways available to an adversary to design a HT, and show that the existing publicly known HT benchmarks are just the tip of the iceberg on this huge landscape.},

Applying our method to a UART controller design, we discover unspecified and untested bus functionality with the potential to leak 32 bits of information during hundreds of cycles without being detected! Our method also reveals poorly tested interrupt functionality with information leakage potential.

abstract = {Nowadays, Hardware Trojan threats have become inevitable due to the growing complexities of Integrated Circuits (ICs) as well as the current trend of Intellectual Property (IP) based hardware designs. An adversary can insert a Hardware Trojan during any of its life cycle phases-during the design, fabrication or even manufacturing phase. Once a Trojan is inserted into a system, it can cause an unwanted modification to system functionality which may degrade system performance or sometimes Trojans are implanted with the target to leak secret information. Once Trojans are implanted, it is hard to detect and impossible to remove it from the system as it is already fabricated into the chip. In this paper, we propose a stealthy Trojan model which affect the coherence mechanism of a Chip Multiprocessors’ (CMPs) cache system by arbitrarily modifying the cache block state which in turn may leave the cache lines states as incoherent. We have evaluated the payload of such modelled Trojan and proposed a cellular automata (CA) based solution for detection of such Trojan.},

Unlike traditional destructive RE approaches, we propose a fast non-destructive side-channel analysis approach that can hierarchically extract structural information from an IC through its transient current signature. Such a top-down side-channel analysis approach is capable of reliably identifying pipeline stages and functional blocks. It is also suitable to distinguish sequential elements from combinational gates. For extraction of random logic structures (e.g. control blocks and finite state machines) we combine side-channel analysis with logic testing based Boolean function extraction. The proposed approach is amenable to automation, scalable, and can be applied as part of post-silicon validation process to verify that each IC implements exclusively the functionality described in the specification and is free from malicious modification or Trojan attacks. Simulation results on a pipelined DLX processor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Malicious modification of integrated circuits (ICs) in untrusted foundry, referred to as "Hardware Trojan", has emerged as a serious security threat. While side-channel analysis has been reported as an effective approach to detect hardware Trojans, increasing process variations in nanoscale technologies pose a major challenge, since process noise can easily mask the Trojan effect on a measured side-channel parameter, such as supply current. Besides, existing side-channel approaches suffer from reduced Trojan detection sensitivity with increasing design size. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable side-channel approach, named self-referencing, along with associated vector generation algorithm to improve the Hardware Trojan detection sensitivity under large process variations. It compares transient current signature of one region of an IC with that of another, thereby nullifying the effect of process noise by exploiting spatial correlation across regions in terms of process variations. To amplify the Trojan effect on supply current, we propose a region-based vector generation approach, which divides a circuit-undertest (CUT) into several regions and for each region, finds the test vectors which induce maximum activity in that region, while minimizing the activity in other regions. We show that the proposed side-channel approach is scalable with respect to both amount of process variations and design size. The approach is validated with both simulation and measurement results using an FPGA-based test setup for large designs including a 32-bit DLX processor core (∼ 105 transistors). Results shows that our approach can find ultra-small (<0.01% area) Trojans under large process variations of up to ± 20% shift in transistor threshold voltage.},

abstract = {Modern integrated circuits (ICs) are vulnerable to Hardware Trojans (HTs) due to the globalization of semiconductor design and fabrication process. HT is an extra circuitry which alters functionality or leaks information making military and financial sectors vulnerable to security threats. The challenge in detection of HTs lies in their clever design and placement that makes them stealthy due to rare activation. While HTs can be detected through power side channels, methodologies that rely on dynamic power, which requires activation of HTs, can prove inefficient. On the other hand, static power based methodologies, which do not require activation of HTs, will be efficient even though they suffer from lower detection sensitivity. In this work, we propose a static power based HT detection methodology where the detection sensitivity is improved by compartmentalizing the circuit, utilizing the sleep transistors used to reduce leakage power. In order to provide efficient HT detection, the power based control is overridden in such a way that only a single sleep transistor is turned ON at any given instance. Even if the Trojan is distributed across the circuit to make it stealthier, the proposed method can effectively detect it. Using the proposed method, detection sensitivity of a 3-bit comparator based HT (0.26% of the total number of gates) has increased from 0.7% to 4.43% without process variations and from 2.03% to 4.32% in the presence of process variations with just 3 controllable sleep transistors The proposed method improved the detection sensitivity of smaller Trojan (only 0.02% of the total number of gates) by 10 folds with just 15 controllable sleep transistors.},

abstract = {Robust Trojans are inserted in outsourced products resulting in security vulnerabilities. Post-silicon testing is done mandatorily to detect such malicious inclusions. Logic testing becomes obsolete for larger circuits with sequential Trojans. For such cases, side channel analysis is an effective approach. The major challenge with the side channel analysis is reduction in hardware Trojan detection sensitivity due to process variation (process variation could lead to false positives and false negatives and it is unavoidable during a manufacturing stage). In this paper Self Referencing method is proposed that measures leakage power of the circuit at four different time windows that hammers the Trojan into triggering and also help to identify/eliminate false positives/false negatives due to process variation.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojan (HT) is a growing concern for the semiconductor industry. As a non-invasive and inexpensive approach, side-channel analysis methods based on signatures such as power, current, or circuit delay are widely used for HT detection. However, the effectiveness of these methods is greatly challenged by the ever-increasing process variation (PV) effects with technology scaling. In this work, considering the inherent relationship among side-channel signatures in a chip, we formulate the HT detection problem as a signature outlier identification problem, and solve it by comparing each signature with an estimated value from other signatures. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique is much more effective than existing solutions.},
