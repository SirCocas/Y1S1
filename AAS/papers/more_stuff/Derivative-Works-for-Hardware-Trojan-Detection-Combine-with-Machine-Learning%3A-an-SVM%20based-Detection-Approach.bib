abstract = {Globalization trend in integrated circuit design and manufacturing process has increased the vulnerability of integrated circuit. These vulnerabilities mainly caused by hardware Trojan have a serious impact on the security of integrated circuits. Although side-channel analysis approach is the most promising Trojan detection approach, nearly all side-channel analysis approaches rely heavily on the availability of golden chips, which are extremely difficult to obtain. In this paper, a golden layout model instead of fabricated golden chips is introduced for the practical application of hardware Trojan detection approaches. The simulated voltage variations generated from the golden layout model at different process corners serve as golden reference, thus fabricated golden chips are not required during detection. Further, silicon measurements are performed to obtain the voltage variations of fabricated chips, and a model calibration algorithm is utilized to calibrate the golden model in the presence of process variations and random noise. Finally, the Trojan detection is formulated as a two-class classification problem, and the Trojan is identified using the partitioning around medoids algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the similarities between the simulated traces and measured traces are greater than 98.81%, and the proposed approach distinguishes the Trojan chips correctly even under ± 15% process variation.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans have emerged as great threat to the trustability of modern electronic systems. A deployed electronic system with one or more undetected Hardware Trojan-infected components can cause grave harm, ranging from personal information loss to destruction of national infrastructure. The inherently surreptitious nature and bewildering variety of Hardware Trojans makes their detection an extremely challenging exercise. In this paper, we explore the state-of-the-art of non-destructive testing for Hardware Trojan detection, with our coverage including both physical measurement based testing, as well as logic testing. We present systematic classification of Hardware Trojans and their detection techniques, and describe these techniques in details, including their stand-out features and strengths and weaknesses. We conclude the paper with an evaluation of the current status of progress, and major directions of future research.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The tremendous advancement in very large scale integration technology encourages chip designers to rely on commercial electronic design automation tools, offshore fabrication services, and outsourced intellectual property cores. As third-party involvement are more in chip design cycle, integrated circuits (IC) such as programmable logic devices (PLD) and application specific ICs (ASIC) are highly vulnerable to hardware Trojan (HT) attacks. HTs are malicious additions or modifications to existing circuit elements, which can be inserted at any stages of IC life cycle to modify/destroy the functionality, reduce reliability, leak sensitive information, etc. Besides, HT can be designed either as always on or triggered only under certain operating conditions. For example, HT attacks in safety critical applications such as nuclear power plant, space and defence will jeopardise the safety and security of the unit and cause serious consequences. Hence, it is most important to ensure that the chip being in use performs only the intended function. In this paper, an in-depth analysis of feasible HT attacks in PLD and ASIC life cycles are presented. Based on the extensive literature survey on HTs and their countermeasure techniques, the state of the art HT prevention, detection, and diagnosis techniques are recommended to the valid stages of PLD and ASIC life cycles. Therefore, incorporating possible HT defence solutions in respective phases of PLD/ASIC-based safety systems thwart them against HT attacks.},

abstract = {The hardware Trojan (HT) has become a major threat for the integrated circuit (IC) industry and supply chain, and has motivated numerous developments of Trojan detection schemes. Although the side-channel method is the most promising one, nearly all of the side-channel methods require fabricated golden chips, which are very difficult to obtain in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for HT detection using electromagnetic side-channel-based spectrum modeling and analyzing. We utilize the design data at early stage of the IC lifecycle, and the generated spectrum can serve as the golden reference, and thus we do not need the fabricated golden chips anymore. Another very important feature is that our method is immune to the process variation theoretically. Experimental results on selected Advanced Encryption Standard benchmark circuits on FPGA show that our proposed method can effectively detect Trojans even with very small traces.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans are a major concern to the overall security and trust of any electronic system. These malicious modifications of circuits are designed to wreak havoc by altering the intended behavior of the system. When triggered, Trojans adversely affect electronics leading to reduced reliability, system failure, remote access into hardware, sensitive information leakage, and damage to a company’s reputation. Hardware Trojans are specifically designed to be rarely activated and undetectable to conventional testing practices and verification methodologies. Trojans can be hidden in many electronic components of integrated circuits (IC), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), system-on-chips (SoC), application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), and third-party intellectual property (3PIP). They can be inserted by adversarial entities including untrusted foundries, designers, vendors, as well as electronic design automation (EDA) and computer-aided design (CAD) software tool suites. The emergence of hardware Trojans has discredited the common argument that hardware is always safe and trustworthy. This chapter provides a detailed insight into hardware Trojans including models, triggers, payloads, attacks, countermeasures, as well as the need to incorporate security through the entire hardware design flow and life cycle of ICs within the global supply chain.},

abstract = {Integrated circuit counterfeits, relabeled parts and maliciously modified integrated circuits (so-called Hardware Trojan horses) are a recognized emerging threat for embedded systems in safety or security critical applications. We propose a Hardware Trojan detection technique based on fingerprinting the electromagnetic emanations of integrated circuits. In contrast to most previous work, we do not evaluate our proposal using simulations but we rather conduct experiments with an FPGA. We investigate the effectiveness of our technique in detecting extremely small Hardware Trojans located at different positions within the FPGA. In addition, we also study its robustness to the often neglected issue of variations in the test environment. The results show that our method is able to detect most of our test Hardware Trojans but also highlight the difficulty of measuring emanations of unrealistically tiny Hardware Trojans. The results also confirm that our method is sensitive to changes in the test environment.},

abstract = {Hardware security and trust have become a pressing issue during the last two decades due to the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain and ubiquitous network connection of computing devices. Computing hardware is now an attractive attack surface for launching powerful cross-layer security attacks, allowing attackers to infer secret information, hijack control flow, compromise system root-of-trust, steal intellectual property (IP), and fool machine learners. On the other hand, security practitioners have been making tremendous efforts in developing protection techniques and design tools to detect hardware vulnerabilities and fortify hardware design against various known hardware attacks. This article presents an overview of hardware security and trust from the perspectives of threats, countermeasures, and design tools. By introducing the most recent advances in hardware security research and developments, we aim to motivate hardware designers and electronic design automation tool developers to consider the new challenges and opportunities of incorporating an additional dimension of security into robust hardware design, testing, and verification.},

abstract = {Current methods for the detection of hardware Trojans inserted by an untrusted foundry are either accompanied by unreasonable costs in design/test pattern overhead, or return results that fail to provide confident trustability. The challenges faced by these side-channel techniques are primarily a result of process variation, which renders pre-silicon expectations nearly meaningless in predicting the behavior of a manufactured IC. To overcome this hindrance in a cost-effective manner, we propose an easy-to-implement test pattern-based approach that is self-referential in nature, capable of dissecting and understanding the characteristics of a given manufactured IC to hone in on aberrant measurements that are demonstrative of malicious Trojan hardware. By leveraging the superposition principle to cancel out non-Trojan noise, we can isolate and magnify Trojan circuit effects, all within a regime considerate of practical test and design-for-test infrastructures. Experimental results performed on Trust-Hub benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method provides a clear and significant boost in our ability to confidently certify manufactured ICs over similar state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {by SEETHARAM NARASIMHAN Implantable systems are used in various contexts for interfacing with the body and for providing real-time monitoring and control capability. In particular, implantable neural interfaces can be used to radically improve our understanding of the nervous system and to provide precise treatments for a variety of neurological problems. However, these systems require significant computing power to perform real-time in-situ analysis of neural signals to recognize behaviorally meaningful patterns which are used to trigger appropriate corrective actions. Due to the tight area and power constraints of neural implants, it is important to develop novel algorithm-architecture-circuit co-design approaches for efficient implementation of neural signal analysis. First, we develop an algorithmic framework which is suitable for ultralow-power hardware implementation while simultaneously satisfying emerging design requirements like reliability and security. The algorithm is based on building a dynamic hierarchical multi-level vocabulary of neural patterns in the wavelet domain. The vocabularybased analysis allows recognition of neural patterns at multiple levels (spike, burst, and pattern of bursts across multiple channels) and transmission of recorded data with large compression, thus, saving power and communication bandwidth of the integrated telemetry device. Hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm aims at reducing system power through choice of appropriate architecture and circuit-level design techniques. We show that a super-threshold design operating at a much higher frequency can achieve comparable energy dissipation as a sub-threshold low-frequency design through application of extensive power gating. It also provides significantly higher robustness of operation and yield under large process variations. We propose an architecture-level preferential design approach for further energy reduction at the},
