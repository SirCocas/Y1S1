1. Without extracting the virtual machine assigned to your team, add it as an
evidence source to FTK Imager running on your computer

2. Create a .e01 forensic image from the virtual machine with FTK Imager
✓ make sure you have enough disk space for the acquisition
✓ split into 4 096 MB files to fit into FAT32 file systems if needed
✓ enable compression, it’s slower, but takes less space
✓ validate the forensic image


Note
====

To convert the Micro XP.vdi into a .vmdk file (readable by FTK), use the following elevated command:

VBoxManage clonehd --format VMDK mydisk.vdi mydisk.vmdk
