abstract = {Despite great interest of researchers and professionals in Information Security (InfoSec) and Information Assurance (IA), there is still no commonly agreed understanding of the disciplines. This chapter clarifies the meaning, scope, and goals of InfoSec and IA as well as the relationship between the disciplines. Clarity of the scope and goals of InfoSec and IA is important because this knowledge serves as a foundation for the definition of (1) curricula for the InfoSec and IA education programs, (2) responsibilities of practitioners, and (3) organisations’ InfoSec strategy and policies. The study analyses US and European InfoSecand IA-related official publications and standards and discusses the perception of the disciplines in academic and industry works. The study highlights the importance of clear and precise definitions of InfoSec and IA and a need for the definitions to promote open-mindedness among practitioners and researchers. Since the existing definitions of InfoSec and IA do not fully reflect the complexity and the evolving nature of the disciplines, the contemporary adapted definitions of InfoSec and IA are elaborated in the chapter.},

Majority of ISMS frameworks that have been implemented and adopted by organizations, centre on the use of technology as a medium for securing information systems. However, information security needs to become an organisation-wide and strategic issue, taking it out of the IT domain and aligning it with the corporate governance approach. The aim of this paper is to highlight the available ISMS frameworks, the basic concept of ISMS, the impact of ISMS on computer networks and internet, the chronological developement of ISMS frameworks and IT Security Management/IT Security Organization. These were accomplished through the review of existing literatures on ISMS frameworks. In essence, it was observed that there is need for every organisation to have an information security management system that can adequately provide reasonable assurance and support for IT applications and business processes.},

Focusing on graduate and undergraduate students from both public and private universities, participants' characteristics were measured against three approaches of mobile devices security practices user-behavior and activities, device settings, and disaster recovery. The sample consisted of 375 students from two public universities and three private university colleges. The results found that Technology and Engineering students differ statistically from Business and Arts students in terms of mobile device settings and disaster recovery practices. The undergraduate students were less engaged in risky activities with their devices compared with the graduate students. Moreover, the younger students were more cautious than the older students regarding user-behavior and device settings. Finally, female students were more negligent when it comes to setting the devices to militate against security threats.},

abstract = {Modern information systems are large-sized and comprise multiple heterogeneous and autonomous components. Autonomy enables decentralization, but it also implies that components providers are free to change, retire, or introduce new components. This is a threat to security, and calls for a continuous verification process to ensure compliance with security policies. Existing verification frameworks either have limited expressiveness—thereby inhibiting the specification of real-world requirements—, or rely on formal languages that are hardly employable for modeling and verifying large systems. In this paper, we overcome the limitations of existing approaches by proposing a framework that enables: (1) specifying information systems in SecBPMN, a security-oriented extension of BPMN; (2) expressing security policies through SecBPMN-Q, a query language for representing security policies; and (3) verifying SecBPMN-Q against SecBPMN specifications via an implemented query engine. We report on the applicability of our approach via a case study about air traffic management.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Employers have long had compelling reasons to monitor employees. For example, management at Los Angeles California City Hall discovered that employees were streaming the 2012 Summer Olympics over the corporate network while at work. Management's response: "Stop watching the Olympics at work!" (Winton, 2012). Events like the Olympics or the annual March Madness basketball tournament impact corporate networks during very specific times, but imagine an employer monitoring its network and discovering that every day employees are watching over 50,000 YouTube videos, streaming over 4,000 hours of music over the internet, or streaming movies from Netflix. This discovery, in fact, prompted Proctor & Gamble to shut down access to movies from Netflix and music from Pandora for its 129,000 employees (Schwartz, 2012). Ensuring employee productivity is a major consideration to support the monitoring processes. But employers have also long been aware of the risk of legal liability or loss to which their organizations may be exposed as a result of inappropriate employee activities online (Papa & Bass, 2004). Lawsuits based on online harassment are typically cited as a concern that justifies employee monitoring, but these are by no means the only legal claims that can arise from employee activity online. In recent years, employee activity on social media outlets, along with employer responses to such activity, have increasingly exposed organizations to liability for unlawful discrimination (Gaskell v. University of Kentucky, 2010), violation of labor laws (Hispanics United of Buffalo, Inc., 2012), and even violation of securities laws (Bondi & Lofchie, 2011). In addition to legal liability for employee misconduct, employers are concerned about threats to their organization's intellectual property as vital data and information are increasingly stored in digital format that is easy for employees to access and distribute outside of the organization's protocols (Willey, Ford, White & Clapper, 2011). To support and justify employee monitoring, employers have adopted policies that attempt to define the limits of permissible employee online activity and identify forms of impermissible online activity that might expose the organization to legal liability or loss. As with all best business practices, it is not enough to simply develop an employee monitoring policy. Successful organizations regularly review and update their policies and review the enforcement of those policies to ensure that they are addressing current concerns in a way that complies with state and federal laws (Rozwell, 2012). The monitoring of employees' emails, internet usage, telephone communications and social media gives rise to confusing legal responses. While some law supports the necessity of monitoring, other law exists to limit the electronic monitoring of employees to protect employee privacy, leaving employers between a rock and hard place. On top of these concerns, recent rulings by the National Labor Relations Board confound the problem for organizations by strictly interpreting monitoring policies that could impact employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act. Additionally, numerous states have either enacted or are considering legislation that would limit the use of social media as a monitoring tool. It's time to take out those monitoring policies, dust them off, and be sure the organization's policies comply with law. AN HISTORICAL LOOK AT ELECTRONIC MONITORING AND A LOOK AT RECENT TRENDS Business organizations are able to use hardware and software to electronically monitor a wide variety of employee behaviors both in and out of the workplace. Attendance and facility use can be monitored using video surveillance and through employee badges where entry and time spent in various access areas is logged. In addition, new applications for physical access cards provide authentication and access to digital systems which may ultimately lead to the convergence of Information Technology (IT) security and physical security (Walls, 2012a). …},

abstract = {Business process modelling is one of the major aspects in the modern information system development. Recently business process model and notation BPMN has become a standard technique to support this activity. Typically the BPMN notations are used to understand enterprise's business processes. However, limited work exists regarding how security concerns are addressed during the management of the business processes. This is a problem, since both business processes and security should be understood in parallel to support a development of the secure information systems. In the previous work we have analysed BPMN with respect to the domain model of the IS security risk management ISSRM and showed how the language constructs could be aligned to the concepts of the ISSRM domain model. In this paper the authors propose the BPMN extensions for security risk management based on the BPMN alignment to the ISSRM concepts. We illustrate how the extended BPMN could express assets, risks and risk treatment on few running examples related to the Internet store regarding the asset confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our proposal would allow system analysts to understand how to develop security requirements to secure important assets defined through business processes. The paper opens the possibility for business and security model interoperability and the model transformation between several modelling approaches if these both are aligned to the ISSRM domain model.},

One of the main areas of research is the behavioral issues in Information Security, primarily focusing on users’ compliance to information security policies. We contribute to this literature by arguing that proper implementation of security policies requires effective training. Specifically, we argue that adherence to security policies could be improved by using training strategies where written policies are ‘shown’. To test our assertion, we use a scenario that users often face when browsing – installation of java applets. Based on previous literature, we identified key antecedents of compliance and tested their effectiveness in an experimental setting. One group of users received guidance from a written policy, whereas the other group was ‘shown’ the meaning of the written policy in the form of a video. Our contribution is simple yet powerful – effective information security training can be accomplished when users are shown the reasons behind the written policies. In other words, in addition to written policies, it is beneficial to actually ‘show’ what the policies accomplish.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe term human capital has roots in the economics literature concerning the valuation of the human element in firm behavior. According to Becker (1962), a human capital perspective is "concerned with activities that influence future real income through the embedding of resources in people" (p. 9). Thus, a human capital approach to management emphasizes investment in the knowledge, skills, abilities and/or competencies of individuals and the workforce, with the expectation of a return in the form of improved organizational performance. Despite its private sector roots, human capital has proven appealing to managers in the public sector eager to invest in the knowledge, skills, and abilities of public servants.For local governments, human capital planning is a must as they face an aging workforce and retirements in key management positions over the next decade (Government Finance Officers Association [GFOA], 2010; Kiyonaga, 2004; Pynes, 2009; Society for Human Resource Management [SHRM], 2010; Wilkerson, 2007). Indeed, the aging workforce is more pronounced in the public sector than it is in the private sector, and the public sector must compete for employees with the nonprofit sector and a private sector that has traditionally offered more lucrative short-term opportunities (Goodman, French, & Battaglio, 2015; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011). The workforce strains on local governments are particularly acute for leadership positions as most of these jobs are filled from within. While economic uncertainty has led many to reconsider early retirement, there is still cause for concern given that many workers in the upcoming workforce do not have the experience to fill crucial leadership roles (Center for State and Local Government Excellence, 2009; GFOA, 2010). A human resources impasse is expected to occur as large numbers of government workers retire and an unquantifiable amount of knowledge and expertise becomes unavailable. Additional challenges in recruiting and retaining talented employees and promoting and supporting employee success have emerged in the ongoing efforts of public organizations to overcome these staffing shortages (Henderson, 2008).Fiscal stress is also a concern of local government personnel systems that have seen a double digit increase among its ranks since the late 1990s. In 1997, there were 12 million local government employees; by 2007 this number increased by 18% to 14.1 million (U.S. Census, 2011). Personnel-related expenditures are typically a dominate feature of local government budgets; however, there is lack of long term strategic plans among municipalities for containing and forecasting personnel costs (Henderson, 2008). The result is a "perfect storm" for the public sector workforce that includes expansions in the 1960s and 1970s; downsizing in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the "brain drain" created by early retirement programs; the declining appeal of public service; competition with the public and nonprofit sectors; lax retirement programs; prohibitions against phased retirement; increased opposition to continued work for government after retirement; and cuts in training and development budgets (Henderson, 2008). Moreover, many localities look to contracting out as an option for controlling personnel-related expenditures. Interest in contracting out HR functions has trended in recent years (Coggburn, 2007; Lavigna, 2003; Wilson, 2006) sparked by efforts at the federal (U.S. Transportation Security Administration) and state (Florida and Texas) levels (Koch, Dell, & Johnson, 2004).Public HR managers are increasingly faced with the realization that in order to continue fulfilling the core functions of their missions in an environment of shrinking resources, a strategic plan for organizational needs, along with investments in employee knowledge, skills, and abilities, is critical. As a result, many public organizations have developed or begun to develop long-term, human capital plans, creating greater interest in strategic HR functions such as workforce planning, hiring, and employee retention. …},

The integration of information security in e-government is no longer an option, but an imperative given the resulting “information overload” and the need to filter “good” from “bad” information. Unless South Africa integrates information security in its e-government development policy and practices, the acclaimed benefits of e-government will not be realized. The moral hazard problems arising from bad information behavior such as human manipulation, withholding information, unauthorized access, and violation of individual privacy and confidentiality heightens the need to combat info-security risks and vulnerabilities. South Africa’s readiness to deal with the information security risks has come under scrutiny. The information security infrastructure in South Africa is also not clearly understood.

Study results confirmed that perceived accountability (r=.512, p<.01) has a significant positive relationship with job performance. Integrating style (r=.664, p<.01), compromising style (r=.508, p<.01) and obliging style (r=.501, p<.01) of conflict management were also found to have a positively significant relationship with job performance.

In contrast, there is little empirical work on the role of human operators during cyber breaches. More specifically, there is a need to understand the human-level factors at play when attacks occur. This paper views cyber attacks through the lens of suspicion, a construct that has been used in other contexts, but inadequately defined, in prior research. After defining the construct of suspicion, the authors demonstrate the role that suspicion plays as the conduit between computer operators' normal working behaviors and their ability to alter that behavior to detect and react to cyber attacks. With a focus on the user, rather than the target computer, the authors empirically develop a latent structure for a variety of types of cyber attacks, link that structure to levels of operator suspicion, link suspicion to users' cognitive and emotional states, and develop initial implications for cyber training.},

abstract = {The main contribution of this thesis is Secure*BPMN, a graphical security modelling extension for the de-facto industry standard business process modelling language BPMN 2.0.1. Secure*BPMN enables a cognitively effective representation of security concerns in business process models. It facilitates the engagement of experts with different backgrounds, including non-security and nontechnical experts, in the discussion of security concerns and in security decision-making. The strength and novelty of Secure*BPMN lie in its comprehensive semantics based on a Reference Model of Information Assurance & Security (RMIAS) and in its cognitively effective syntax. 
The RMIAS, which was developed in this project, is a synthesis of the existing knowledge of the Information Assurance & Security domain. The RMIAS helps to build an agreed-upon understanding of Information Assurance & Security, which experts with different backgrounds require before they may proceed with the discussion of security issues. The development process of the RMIAS, which was made explicit, and the multiphase evaluation carried out confirmed the completeness and accuracy of the RMIAS, and its suitability as a foundation for the semantics of Secure*BPMN. The RMIAS, which has multiple implications for research, education and practice is a secondary contribution of this thesis, and is a contribution to the Information Assurance & Security domain in its own right. 
The syntax of Secure*BPMN complies with the BPMN extensibility rules and with the scientific principles of cognitively effective notation design. The analytical and empirical evaluations corroborated the ontological completeness, cognitive effectiveness, ease of use and usefulness of Secure*BPMN. It was verified that Secure*BPMN has a potential to be adopted in practice.},

Industrial relations is generally understood to refer to the relationship between employers and employees collectively. The shift in the coverage and content of collective bargaining has been reflected in a dramatic reduction in industrial action. The emphasis of employee relations continues to shift from ‘collective’ institutions to the relationship with individual employees. ER skills and competencies are seen by employers as critical in achieving performance benefits through a focus on employee involvement, commitment and engagement. Thus, the basic responsibility of HRD as a subsystem of HRM is to imbibe positive attitudes and cordial relationship in the organization. Therefore, HRD as a strategy became forerunner in every organization to build confidence, commitment and also competencies required at all levels to meet global challenges as well as challenges of ER. The paper empirically examines the impact of HRD initiatives on the performance of ER system in a giant public sector steel industry in South India. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that HRD initiatives have an impact on the performance of employment relations system in the organization and provide limited support for the hypothesis that HRD initiatives help in reduction of unauthorized absenteeism and improve employee involvement in suggestion scheme.},

abstract = {Organizational justice has been researched as an antecedent of the organizational commitment and is important because it has been linked to critical organizational processes such as commitment, citizenship, job satisfaction and performance. In the technology organization context, commitment of employees has a strategic value. A sample consisting of 225 IT employees were surveyed for the present study. The judgmental sampling technique was adopted. Perceptions of organizational justice and commitment were measured adopting standardized, reliable and valid scales. The major findings were that IT employees were treated with only moderate fairness/justice by the organizations, however, their commitment to their organization was fairly high. It was found that organizational justice significantly influenced organizational commitment of IT employees. The results of this study provide considerable insight into the IT employees’ perceptions of fairness that promote commitment. The implications of the study focus on strategies for increasing organizational justice and are discussed in detail.},

There are several languages for security modelling that help dealing with security risk management at the requirements stage. [Question/problem] In this paper, we are focusing on Mal-activity diagrams that are used from requirement engineering to system design stage. More specifically we investigate how this language supports information systems security risks management (ISSRM). [Principal ideas/results] The outcome of this work is an alignment table between the Mal-activity diagrams language constructs to the ISSRM domain model concepts. [Contribution] This result may help developers understand how to model security risks at the system requirement and design stages. Also, it paves the way for interoperability between the modelling languages that are analysed using the same conceptual framework, thus facilitating transformation between these modelling approaches.},

Different security modeling language or security extension is used to model security features of IS. Mal Activity Diagram (MAD) is used at the design stage to represent security aspect. But it cannot model all the security risk management concepts. Without full coverage of concepts, it is not possible to model an IS efficiently and correctly. In this paper, first we propose a meta model for MAD which will help developers or other stakeholders to understand and use MAD correctly. Then we propose syntactic and semantic extensions of MAD to model all the risk management concepts. We have used this meta model and extension in a case study. This study shows that the meta model and extensions help us to correctly identify and model different security components of the system.},

abstract = {Business process modelling is one of the major aspects in the modern system development. Recently business process model and notation (BPMN) has become a standard technique to support this activity. Although BPMN is a good approach to understand business processes, there is a limited work to understand how it could deal with business security and security risk management. This is a problem, since both business processes and security concerns should be understood in parallel to support a development of the secure systems. In this paper we analyse BPMN with respect to the domain model of the IS security risk management (ISSRM). We apply a structured approach to understand key aspects of BPMN and how modeller could express secure assets, risks and risk treatment using BPMN. We align the main BPMN constructs with the key concepts of the ISSRM domain model. We show applicability of our approach on a running example related to the Internet store. Our proposal would allow system analysts to understand how to develop security requirements to secure important assets defined through business processes. In addition we open a possibility for the business and security model interoperability and the model transformation between several modelling approaches (if these both are aligned to the ISSRM domain model).},

Yet, the case study also shows that in most cases employees tend to represent the ideas and goals of their respective employer. The chapter observes that the non-technical factors are ignored all too often in the literature.

abstract = {Organizations should measure their information security performance if they wish to take the right decisions and develop it in line with their security needs. Since the measurement of information security is generally underdeveloped in practice and many organizations find the existing recommendations too complex, the paper presents a solution in the form of a 10 by 10 information security performance measurement model. The model—ISP 10×10M is composed of ten critical success factors, 100 key performance indicators and 6 performance levels. Its content was devised on the basis of findings presented in the current research studies and standards, while its structure results from an empirical research conducted among information security professionals from Slovenia. Results of the study show that a high level of information security performance is mostly dependent on measures aimed at managing information risks, employees and information sources, while formal and environmental factors have a lesser impact. Experts believe that information security should evolve systematically, where it’s recommended that beginning steps include technical, logical and physical security controls, while advanced activities should relate predominantly strategic management activities. By applying the proposed model, organizations are able to determine the actual level of information security performance based on the weighted indexing technique. In this manner they identify the measures they ought to develop in order to improve the current situation. The ISP 10×10M is a useful tool for conducting internal system evaluations and decision-making. It may also be applied to a larger sample of organizations in order to determine the general state-of-play for research purposes.},

abstract = {In this chapter we describe a news trends detection system built with the aim of detecting daily trends in a big collection of news articles extracted from the web and expose the computed trends data as open linked data that can be consumed by other components of the IT infrastructure. Due to the sheer amount of data being processed, the system relies on big data technologies to process raw news data and compute the trends that will be later exposed as open linked data. Thanks to the open linked data interface, data can be easily consumed by other components of the application, like a JavaScript front-end, or re-used by different IT systems. The case is a good example of how open linked data can be used to provide a convenient interface to big data systems. ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND The organization involved in the project is an Internet company providing data analysis services for different kinds of web data. Integration of different data sources capable of generating more useful insights on clients’ data is an essential task in the company strategy. From the organizational point of view, the software development process is accomplished by small and highly autonomous engineering teams responsible for different projects and relying on services provided by other teams. Use of big data technologies means that many times resources like computer clusters must be shared by different teams. This practice demands a high degree of cooperation between teams. Within this context of small teams building a network of services that are used and combined by other teams, the use of open linked data makes it possible for the easy inter-operability between data resources as well as provides a shared vocabulary for the outcome data, processed by big data systems like Apache Hadoop.

Nevertheless, existing practices report on numerous cases when security aspects were considered only at the end of the development process, thus, missing the systematic security analysis. Misuse case diagrams help identify security concerns at early stages of the IS development. Despite this fundamental advantage, misuse cases tend to be rather imprecise; they do not comply with security risk management strategies, and, thus, could lead to misinterpretation of the security-related concepts. Such limitations could potentially result in poor security solutions. This paper applies a systematic approach to understand how misuse case diagrams could help model organisational assets, potential risks, and security countermeasures to mitigate these risks. The contribution helps understand how misuse cases could deal with security risk management and support reasoning for security requirements and their implementation in the software system.},

abstract = {Business processes are essential instruments used for the coordination of organisational activities in order to produce value in the form of products and services. Information security is an important non-functional characteristic of business processes due to the involvement of sensitive data exchanged between their participants. Therefore, potential security shortfalls can severely impact organisational reputation, customer trust and cause compliance issues. Nevertheless, despite its importance, security is often considered as a technical concern and treated as an afterthought during the design of information systems and the business processes which they support. The consideration of security during the early design stages of information systems is highly beneficial. Goal-oriented security requirements engineering approaches can contribute to the early elicitation of system requirements at a high level of abstraction and capture the organisational context and rationale behind design choices. Aligning such requirements with process activities at the operational level augments the traceability between system models of different abstraction levels and leads to more robust and context-aware operationalisations of security. Therefore, there needs to be a well-defined and verifiable interconnection between a system’s security requirements and its business process models. This work introduces a framework for the design of secure business process models. It uses security-oriented goal models as its starting point to capture a socio-technical view of the system to-be and its security requirements during its early design stages. Concept mappings and model transformation rules are also introduced as a structured way of extracting business process skeletons from such goal models, in order to facilitate the alignment between the two different levels of abstraction. The extracted business process skeletons, are refined to complete business process models through the use of a set of security patterns, which standardise proven solutions to recurring security problems. Finally, the framework also offers security verification capabilities of the produced process models through the introduction of security-related attributes and model checking algorithms. Evaluation of this work is performed: (i) through individual evaluation of its components via their application in real-life systems, (ii) a workshop-based modelling exercise where participants used and evaluated parts of the framework and (iii) a case study from the public administration domain where the overall framework was applied in cooperation with stakeholders of the studied system. The evaluation indicated that the developed framework provides a structured ap-},
