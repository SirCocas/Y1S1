abstract = {In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.},

abstract = {The popularity of ransomware has created a unique ecosystem of cybercriminals. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to provide a thorough understanding of ransomware’s threat and discuss recent detection techniques used. Successful ransomware attack has direct financial implication, which is fuelled by several mature enablers, such as encryption technology, cyber currency and accessibility. Encryption is effective and almost unbreakable. Anonymous cyber currency can avoid traceability. Easily obtainable ransomware code enables easy entry. A combination of these provides an attractive avenue for cybercriminals, producing specialist cybercriminals. In terms of detection techniques, it was found that machine learning (ML) via regression algorithms was the most technique adopted by researchers of ransomware. However, none of the researchers have produced any model to protect against ransomware attack. This research highlights the need of a solution using ML algorithm for the detection engine.},

abstract = {Abstract The irreversible effect is what characterizes crypto-ransomware and distinguishes it from traditional malware. That is, even after neutralizing the attack, the targeted files remain encrypted and cannot be accessed without the decryption key. Thus, it is imperative to detect such a threat early, i.e. in the initial phases before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of sufficient information in initial phases of the attack is the main challenge to early detection, leading to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. This is due to the way that the existing solutions have been designed based on, which assumes the availability of complete information about the behavior of such attacks at detection time. Nevertheless, this does not hold for early detection that takes place while the attack is underway, and data are not fully available. To address such limitations, this paper proposes two novel techniques; incremental bagging (iBagging) and enhanced semi-random subspace selection (ESRS), and incorporates them into an ensemble-based detection model. The proposed iBagging was firstly used to build incremental subsets in a way that reflects the progression of crypto-ransomware behavior during its different attack phases. ESRS was then used to build optimal, noise-free and diverse features subspaces, by which, a pool of classifiers was trained. Finally, a grid search was employed to select the best combination of base classifiers. Majority voting was utilized for the final decision. The experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques and model was conducted and compared with the existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed techniques and model overcame the data limitation in the early phases of the attacks and achieved higher detection accuracy than existing solutions.},

Several solutions have proposed utilizing the data extracted during the initial phases of the attacks before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of enough data at the early phases of the attack along with high dimensional features space renders the model prone to overfitting which decreases its detection accuracy. To this end, this paper proposed a novel redundancy coefficient gradual up-weighting approach that was incorporated to the calculation of redundancy term of mutual information to improve the feature selection process and enhance the accuracy of the detection model. Several machine learning classifiers were used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed techniques.

abstract = {Local Area Network (LAN) workstations that operate at the edge tier of Industrial Internet of Things systems (IIoT) and have direct or indirect interaction with critical control devices could be a key vector for advanced threats against control systems, such as a ransomware threat. This indicates that there is a necessity for monitoring these workstations to detect any malicious behavior related to ransomware, and generating an alarm to prevent the ransomware from expanding its activity to more critical system entities. The efficient detection of a ransomware attack very much relies on how accurately its activities are understood and how its traits are discovered. This can help in distinguishing ransomware from legitimate system activities. In this paper, we utilize deep learning techniques to extract the latent representation of a high dimension of collected data to identify malicious behavior accurately. Specifically, the model that we propose is based on a hybrid feature engineering technique of classical and variational auto-encoders. This hybrid technique is used to reduce the dimension of data and extract a good representation of the collected system activities. Then, the new feature vector is passed to a classifier that is built based on deep neural network and batch normalization techniques. The paper concludes with experimental results demonstrating that our model performs better in detecting ransomware compared with other existing models.},

abstract = {Abstract Crypto ransomware is a type of malware that locks access to user files by encrypting them and demands a ransom in order to obtain the decryption key. This type of malware has become a serious threat for most enterprises. In those cases where the infected computer has access to documents in network shared volumes, a single host can lock access to documents across several departments in the company. We propose an algorithm that can detect ransomware action and prevent further activity over shared documents. The algorithm is based on the analysis of passively monitored traffic by a network probe. 19 different ransomware families were used for testing the algorithm in action. The results show that it can detect ransomware activity in less than 20 s, before more than 10 files are lost. Recovery of even those files was also possible because their content was stored in the traffic monitored by the network probe. Several days of traffic from real corporate networks were used to validate a low rate of false alarms. This paper offers also analytical models for the probability of early detection and the probability of false alarms for an arbitrarily large population of users.},

abstract = {Abstract Traditional non-semantic file systems are not sufficient in protecting file systems against attacks, either caused by ransomware attacks or software-related defects. Furthermore, outbreaks of new malware often cannot provide a large quantity of training samples for machine-learning-based approaches to counter malware campaigns. The malware defense system should aim to achieve the best balance between early detection and detection accuracy. In this paper, we present a situation-aware access control framework to work with existing file systems as a stackable add-on. Our framework enables the access control decision making to be deferred when required, to observe the consequence of such an access request to the file system and to roll back changes if required. As an application against ransomware attacks, it can be applied to preserve file content integrity, by enforcing that all binary files written to the file system have consistent internal file structures with the declared file types, and rolling back changes that violate such constraints. We envision our access control framework to complement existing operating system access control frameworks, to significantly reduce the dimension of data required for machine learning, and to build extra resilience into the operating systems against damages caused by either malware or software defects. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework through a prototype testing, capturing relevant ransomware situations. The experimental results along with a large ransomware dataset show that our framework can be effectively applied in practice.},

 The COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed a huge surge in the number of ransomware attacks. Different institutions such as healthcare, financial, and government have been targeted. There can be numerous reasons for such a sudden rise in attacks, but it appears working remotely in home-based environments (which is less secure compared to traditional institutional networks) could be one of the reasons. Cybercriminals are constantly exploring different approaches like social engineering attacks, such as phishing attacks, to spread ransomware. Hence, in this paper, we explored recent advances in ransomware prevention and detection and highlighted future research challenges and directions. We also carried out an analysis of a few popular ransomware samples and developed our own experimental ransomware, AESthetic, that was able to evade detection against eight popular antivirus programs.

abstract = {Ransomware is a growing threat that typically operates by either encrypting a victim’s files or locking a victim’s computer until the victim pays a ransom. However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called “Peeler” (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware’s inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system’s kernel events and detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that Peeler achieves more than 99% detection rate with 0.58% false-positive rate against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto and screen-locker types of ransomware. For crypto ransomware, Peeler detects them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average). Peeler utilizes around 4.9% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the normal workload condition. Our analysis demonstrates that Peeler can efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level events.},

The study analysed literature from different perspectives focusing on intelligent algorithms detection of ransomware. The survey shows that there is a growing interest in recent times (2016—date) on the application of intelligent algorithms for ransomware detection. Deep learning algorithms are gaining tremendous attention because of their ability to handle large scale datasets, prominence in the research community, and ability to solve problems better than the conventional intelligent algorithms. To date, the potentials of big data analytics are yet to be fully exploited for the smart detection of ransomware attacks. Future research opportunities from the perspective of deep learning and big data analytics to solve the challenges identified from the survey are outlined to give the research community a new direction in dealing with ransomware attacks.},

Motivated by recent promotions of technology, ransomware attack has soared saliently in terms of volume, versatility, and intricacy. This attack has initiated a lucrative trade by holding users’ resources, whether data or non-data, hostage and demanding to pay ransom for release them. Furthermore, it has begun to camouflage other malware in many cyber-attacks. As a result, designing approaches to vanquish such threat should be taken into account. Understanding attack cycle and having an exhaustive taxonomy of ransomware, specially associated technologies, can assist to develop security measures at the various parts of attack flow. This paper has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of ransomware and digital extortion threats. A discrete and dedicated attack chain called I2CE3 has been proposed for ransomware regardless of its subcategories. The proposed chain offers six consecutive phases that ransomware species go through to triumph in attack. Afterwards, the present work has elaborated the role of all technologies involved in each phase. Finally, based on the proffered chain, performed studies and security solutions have been considered and segregated.},

Notably, since the introduction of WannaCry, numerous ransomware detection solution has been proposed. However, the ransomware incidence report shows that most organizations impacted by ransomware are running state of the art ransomware detection tools. Hence, an alternative solution is an urgent requirement as the existing detection models are not sufficient to spot emerging ransomware treat. With this motivation, our work proposes "DeepGuard," a novel concept of modeling user behavior for ransomware detection. The main idea is to log the file-interaction pattern of typical user activity and pass it through deep generative autoencoder architecture to recreate the input. With sufficient training data, the model can learn how to reconstruct typical user activity (or input) with minimal reconstruction error. Hence, by applying the three-sigma limit rule on the model’s output, DeepGuard can distinguish the ransomware activity from the user activity. The experiment result shows that DeepGuard effectively detects a variant class of ransomware with minimal false-positive rates. Overall, modeling the attack detection with user-behavior permits the proposed strategy to have deep visibility of various ransomware families.},

abstract = {Ransomware is among the most dangerous malware prevailing in today’s world. Once infected, the malware either encrypts the data or lock the system screen, and prevents the owner from accessing his data and system until some ransom money is paid, resulting in multi-million dollars of cyber-extortion annually. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the owner would regain access to the seized data after payment is made. Ransomware attacks keep troubling the cybersecurity community; researchers are working towards developing efficient techniques for the detection and prevention of ransomware attacks. In this paper, we are attempting to review the existing solutions based on the methodology adopted and validate them using specific performance metrics.},

abstract = {Cyber Security researchers are in an ongoing battle against ransomware attacks. Some exploits begin with social engineering methods to install payloads on victims’ computers, followed by a communication with command and control servers for data exchange. To scale down these attacks, scientists should shed light on the danger of those rising intrusions to prevent permanent data loss. To join this arm race against malware, we propose in this paper an analysis of various ransomware families based on the collected system and network logs from a computer. We delve into malicious network traffic generated by these samples to perform a packet level detection. Our goal is to reconstruct ransomware’s full activity to check if its network communication is distinguishable from benign traffic. Then, we examine if the first packet sent occurs before data’s encryption to alert the administrators or afterwards. We aim to define the first occurrence of the alert raised by malicious network traffic and where it takes place in a ransomware workflow.

abstract = {Ransomware remains an alarming threat in the 21st century. It has evolved from being a simple scare tactic into a complex malware capable of evasion. Formerly, end-users were targeted via mass infection campaigns. Nevertheless, in recent years, the attackers have focused on targeted attacks, since the latter are profitable and can induce severe damage. A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used. Finally, we propose a roadmap for researchers to fill the gaps found in the literature in ransomware’s battle.},

abstract = {Desktop and portable platform-based information systems become the most tempting target of crypto and locker ransomware attacks during the last decades. Hence, researchers have developed anti-ransomware tools to assist the Windows platform at thwarting ransomware attacks, protecting the information, preserving the users’ privacy, and securing the inter-related information systems through the Internet. Furthermore, they utilized machine learning to devote useful antiransomware tools that detect sophisticated versions. However, such anti-ransomware tools remain sub-optimal in efficacy, partial to analyzing ransomware traits, inactive to learn significant and imbalanced data streams, limited to attributing the versions’ ancestor families, and indecisive about fusing the multi-descent versions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid machine learner model, which is a multi-tiered streaming analytics model that classifies various ransomware versions of 14 families by learning 24 static and dynamic traits. The proposed model classifies ransomware versions to their ancestor families numerally and fuses those of multi-descent families statistically. Thus, it classifies ransomware versions among 40K corpora of ransomware, malware, and goodware versions through both semi-realistic and realistic environments. The supremacy of this ransomware streaming analytics model among competitive anti-ransomware technologies is proven experimentally and justified critically with the average of 97% classification accuracy, 2.4% mistake rate, and 0.34% miss rate under comparative and realistic test.},

abstract = {Modern electronic devices have become “smart” as well as omnipresent in our day-to-day lives. From small household devices to large industrial machines, smart devices have become very popular in every possible application domain. Smart devices in our homes, offices, buildings, and cities can connect with other devices as well as with the physical world around them. This increasing popularity has also placed smart devices as the center of attention among attackers. Already, several types of malicious activities exist that attempt to compromise the security and privacy of smart devices. One interesting and noteworthy emerging threat vector is the attacks that abuse the use of sensors on smart devices. Smart devices are vulnerable to sensor-based threats and attacks due to the lack of proper security mechanisms available to control the use of sensors by installed apps. By exploiting the sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, light sensor, etc.) on a smart device, attackers can extract information from the device, transfer malware to a device, or trigger a malicious activity to compromise the device. In this paper, we explore various threats and attacks abusing sensors of smart devices for malicious purposes. Specifically, we present a detailed survey about existing sensor-based threats and attacks to smart devices and countermeasures that have been developed to secure smart devices from sensor-based threats. Furthermore, we discuss security and privacy issues of smart devices in the context of sensor-based threats and attacks and conclude with future research directions.},

Several articles have presented detection techniques for this type of malware; these techniques are applied before the ransomware encrypts files or during its action in an infected host. The evaluation of these proposals has always been accomplished using sets of ransomware samples that are prepared locally for the research article, without making the data available. Different studies use different sets of samples and different evaluation metrics, resulting in insufficient comparability. In this paper, we describe a public data repository containing the file access operations of more than 70 ransomware samples during the encryption of a large network shared directory. These data have already been used successfully in the evaluation of a network-based ransomware detection algorithm. Now, we are making these data available to the community and describing their details, how they were captured, and how they can be used in the evaluation and comparison of the results of most ransomware detection techniques.},

abstract = {The cryptography employed against user files makes the effect of crypto-ransomware attacks irreversible even after detection and removal. Thus, detecting such attacks early, i.e. during pre-encryption phase before the encryption takes place is necessary. Existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions use a fixed time-based thresholding approach to determine the pre-encryption phase boundaries. However, the fixed time thresholding approach implies that all samples start the encryption at the same time. Such assumption does not necessarily hold for all samples as the time for the main sabotage to start varies among different crypto-ransomware families due to the obfuscation techniques employed by the malware to change its attack strategies and evade detection, which generates different attack behaviors. Additionally, the lack of sufficient data at the early phases of the attack adversely affects the ability of feature extraction techniques in early detection models to perceive the characteristics of the attacks, which, consequently, decreases the detection accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a Dynamic Pre-encryption Boundary Delineation and Feature Extraction (DPBD-FE) scheme that determines the boundary of the pre-encryption phase, from which the features are extracted and selected more accurately. Unlike the fixed thresholding employed by the extant works, DPBD-FE tracks the pre-encryption phase for each instance individually based on the first occurrence of any cryptography-related APIs. Then, an annotated Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (aTF-IDF) technique was utilized to extract the features from runtime data generated during the pre-encryption phase of crypto-ransomware attacks. The aTF-IDF overcomes the challenge of insufficient attack patterns during the early phases of the attack lifecycle. The experimental evaluation shows that DPBD-FE was able to determine the pre-encryption boundaries and extract the features related to this phase more accurately compared to related works.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware employs the cryptography to lock user personal files and demands ransom to release them. By utilizing several technological utilities like cyber-currency and cloud-based developing platforms, crypto-ransomware has gained high popularity among adversaries. Motivated by the monetary revenue, crypto-ransomware developers continuously produce many variants of such malicious programs to evade the detection. Consequently, the rate of crypto-ransomware novel attacks is continuously increasing. As such, it is imperative for detection solutions to be able to discover these novel attacks, also called zero-day attacks. While anomaly detection-based solutions are able to deal with this problem, they suffer the high rate of false alarms. Thus, this paper puts forward a detection model that incorporates anomaly with behavioral detection approaches. In this model, two types of detection estimators were built. The first type is an ensemble of behavioral-based classifiers whereas the second type is an anomaly-based estimator. The decisions of both types of estimators were combined using fusion technique. The proposed model is able to detect the novel attack while maintaining low false alarms rate. By applying the proposed model, the detection rate was increased from 96% to 99% and the false positive rate was as low as 2.4 %.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to a victim’s computing resources and demands a ransom in order to restore access. This is a continually growing and costly threat across the globe, therefore efforts have been made both in academia and industry to develop techniques that can help to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of Windows-based anti-ransomware tools and techniques, using a clear, simple and consistent terminology in terms of Data Sources, Processing and Actions. We extensively analysed relevant literature so that, to the best of our knowledge, we had at the time covered all approaches taken to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. We grouped these techniques according to their main features as a way to understand the landscape. We then selected 15 existing anti-ransomware tools both to examine how they fit into this landscape and to compare them by aggregating their accuracy and overhead – two of the most important selection criteria of these tools – as reported by the tools’ respective authors. We were able to determine popular solutions and unexplored gaps that could lead to promising areas of anti-ransomware development. From there, we propose two novel detection techniques, namely serial byte correlation and edit distance. This paper serves as a much needed roadmap of knowledge and ideas to systematise the current landscape of anti-ransomware tools.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a type of advanced malware that has spread rapidly in recent years, causing significant financial losses for a wide range of victims, including organizations, healthcare facilities, and individuals. Modern host-based detection methods require the host to be infected first in order to identify anomalies and detect the malware. By the time of infection, it can be too late as some of the system’s assets would have been already exfiltrated or encrypted by the malware. Conversely, the network-based methods can be effective in detecting ransomware attacks, as most ransomware families try to connect to command and control servers before their harmful payloads are executed. Therefore, a careful analysis of ransomware network traffic can be one of the key means for early detection. This paper demonstrates a comprehensive behavioral analysis of crypto ransomware network activities, taking Locky, one of the most serious families, as a case study. A dedicated testbed was built, and a set of valuable and informative network features were extracted and classified into multiple types. A network-based intrusion detection system was implemented, employing two independent classifiers working in parallel on different levels: packet and flow levels. The experimental evaluation of the proposed detection system demonstrates that it offers high detection accuracy, low false positive rate, valid extracted features, and is highly effective in tracking ransomware network activities.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is a malware category that targets user-related files to encrypt them and hold them to ransom. The irreversible effect of crypto-ransomware attacks entails early detection before it starts encrypting the files. Although several works have been proposed to detect such attacks at the pre-encryption phase before the encryption takes place, the main limitation of these works is the way in which they define the boundaries of the pre-encryption phase. That is, these studies determine the pre-encryption boundaries based on tracking the first call of any cryptography-related Application Programming Interface (API). However, relying on the first call of cryptography-related APIs to delineate the pre-encryption boundaries is not accurate as these APIs might be related to other (normal) tasks done by the crypto-ransomware, such as unpacking and/or decrypting the metamorphic payload, before the ransomware starts the malicious activities. In that case, the collected pre-encryption data lack many relevant pre-encryption attack patterns that come after the mistakenly-identified pre-encryption boundary. Such data insufficiency adversely affects the accuracy of the detection model and increases the rate of false alarms. To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes an early detection model (CRED) that can determine the pre-encryption boundaries and collect the data related to this phase more accurately. Unlike the extant research, the CRED model employs data-centric and process-centric detection approaches to combine both IRP and API data. These data will then be used to train a deep learning-based model. The CRED model will be evaluated using a data-benchmark collected by executing real-world crypto-ransomware samples downloaded from a widely-used repository. The performance of the detection model will be validated using the k-fold cross validation and compared against the models proposed by the existing works.},

abstract = {In the last decade, crypto-ransomware evolved from a family of malicious software with scarce repercussion in the research community, to a sophisticated and highly effective intrusion method positioned in the spotlight of the main organizations for cyberdefense. Its modus operandi is characterized by fetching the assets to be blocked, their encryption, and triggering an extortion process that leads the victim to pay for the key that allows their recovery. This paper reviews the evolution of crypto-ransomware focusing on the implication of the different advances in communication technologies that empowered its popularization. In addition, a novel defensive approach based on the Self-Organizing Network paradigm and the emergent communication technologies (e.g. Software-Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, Cloud Computing, etc.) is proposed. They enhance the orchestration of smart defensive deployments that adapt to the status of the monitoring environment and facilitate the adoption of previously defined risk management policies. In this way it is possible to efficiently coordinate the efforts of sensors and actuators distributed throughout the protected environment without supervision by human operators, resulting in greater protection with increased viability},

abstract = {Digital extortion has become a major cyber risk for many organizations; small-medium enterprises (SME) to large enterprises business and individual entrepreneurs. Ransomware is a kind of malware that is the main threat to digital extortion and has caused many organizations to lose huge revenue by paying much bigger ransom demands to the cybercriminals in recent years. The explosive growth of ransomware is due to the existing large infection vector such as social engineering, email attachment, zip file download, browsing malicious site, infected search engine which are boosted dramatically by easily available cryptographic tools, Ransomware As a Service (RaaS), increased cloud storage and off-the-self ransomware toolkits. The large infection vector and available toolkits not only grew ransomware extremely, but also made them more obfuscated, encrypted and varying patterns in the new variants. This, in turn, caused the conventional supervised analysis and detection engine to fail to detect the new variants of ransomware. This paper addresses the limitations of conventional supervised detection engine and proposes semi-supervised framework to compute the inherent latent sources of the varying patterns in the new variants in an unsupervised way using deep learning approaches. The proposed framework extracts the inherent characteristics in the varying patterns from the unlabelled ransomware obtained from the wild which is scalable to accommodate upcoming malicious executables. Then the unsupervised learned model is combined with supervised classification, thus constructing an adaptive detection model. The proposed framework has been verified using real ransomware data with a dynamic analysis testbed. Our extensive experimental results and discussion demonstrate that the proposed adaptive framework can successfully identify different variants of ransomware and achieve higher performance than existing supervised approaches.},

The attackers launching ransomware attacks use different techniques to hijack the users’ or organizations’ files and resources to demand ransom in exchange to free the encrypted/captured data or resources. Although there are many malware attacks, ransomware is considered most dangerous as it imposes a high financial burden on the organization. The crypto-currency is an untraceable payment method that the attacker uses to receive ransom from victims to conceal his/her identity and location. This still creates challenges to trace the attacker or attackers’ networks. The article uses the systematic literature review (SLR) approach to provide significant study on the ransomware attacks as it is the area that requires top most attention in critical infrastructure. The paper briefs the various types of ransomware, vulnerabilities, attack methodologies, impacts, mitigation and prevention techniques of the attacks. This research study is mainly focused on Windows OS vulnerabilities. These findings in the survey will be highly beneficial to understand the effects of ransomware attacks in critical infrastructure environments and the use of machine learning to detect and prevent these attacks.},

abstract = {As technology becomes more widely available, millions of users worldwide have installed some form of smart device in their homes or workplaces. These devices are often off-theshelf commodity systems, such as Google Home or Samsung SmartThings, that are installed by end-users looking to automate a small deployment. In contrast to these “plug-and-play” systems, purpose-built Enterprise Internet-of-Things (E-IoT) systems such as Crestron, Control4, RTI, Savant offer a smart solution for more sophisticated applications (e.g., complete lighting control, A/V management, security). In contrast to commodity systems, E-IoT systems are usually closed source, costly, require certified installers, and are overall more robust for their use cases. Due to this, E-IoT systems are often found in expensive smart homes, government and academic conference rooms, yachts, and smart private offices. However, while there has been plenty of research on the topic of commodity systems, no current study exists that provides a complete picture of E-IoT systems, their components, and relevant threats. As such, lack of knowledge of E-IoT system threats, coupled with the cost of E-IoT systems has led many to assume that E-IoT systems are secure. To address this research gap, raise awareness on E-IoT security, and motivate further research, this work emphasizes E-IoT system components, E-IoT vulnerabilities, solutions, and their security implications. In order to systematically analyze the security of E-IoT systems, we divide E-IoT systems into four layers: E-IoT Devices Layer, Communications Layer, Monitoring and Applications Layer, and Business Layer. We survey attacks and defense mechanisms, considering the E-IoT components at each layer and the associated threats. In addition, we present key observations in state-of-the-art E-IoT security and provide a list of open research problems that need further research.},

Un des challenges de cette these etant de faire concilier performance, taux de detection et un faible taux de faux positifs. Enfin, les resultats d'une experience utilisateur sont presentes. Cette experience analyse le comportement des utilisateurs face a une menace. En derniere partie, nous proposons des ameliorations a nos contributions mais aussi des pistes a explorer.},

abstract = {Abstract Crypto ransomware is a type of malware that locks its victim’s file for ransom using an encryption algorithm. Its popularity has risen at an alarming rate among the cyber security community due to several successful worldwide attacks. The encryption employed had caused irreversible damage to the victim’s digital files, even when the victim chooses to pay the ransom. Therefore, this research proposes the Pre-Encryption Detection Algorithm (PEDA) that can detect crypto-ransomware at the pre-encryption stage, when no encryption has been done. PEDA provides two levels of detection; the first level of detection was before the ransomware can be activated using a signature comparison with a known crypto-ransomware’s signature. The signature was generated using SHA-256 (Secure Hashing Algorithm) that allowed fast and accurate comparison of the file content. The second level of detection used Learning Algorithm (LA) that can detect crypto-ransomware based on pre-encryption application program interface (API). The LA produced a 100% recall rate based on 80:20 ratios of training and testing, and 99.9% recall rate with a 10-fold cross-verification test. In addition, this research had also successfully identified fourteen important APIs that can differentiate between ransomware and goodware. Three APIs were present in most ransomware, but less in goodware; these APIs were NtProtectVirtualMemory, NtResumeThread, and NtTerminateProcess. Eleven APIs, on the other hand, were mostly present in goodware, but less in ransomware; these APIs were NtWriteVirtualMemory, UuidCreate, NtDelayExecution, NtSetInformationFile, NtWriteFile, CreateThread, NtReadVirtualMemory, VirtualFreeEx, CreateDirectoryW, VirtualProtectEx, and SetFilePointer.},

abstract = {Central themes of this book have revolved around rethinking sovereignty and the global economy. What happens when we introduce the notion of cyberspace, a domain that appears to eliminate political jurisdictions and to move globalization to a new level? Do black spots become less relevant to the study of illicit activities as criminals, insurgents, and terrorists increasingly adopt cyber-technology? Or are black spots just as likely to be found in this so-called virtual world in ways similar to the physical world of states? This chapter explores if there are black spots in cyberspace. We start by introducing the concept of cyberspace and exploring how it relates to the illicit world. Of interest are the various ways criminal actors use cyber-technology to enhance their operations. In other words, are illicit activities changing in response to the evolution of cyberspace? Building on this discussion, we show the relevance of the notion of black spots to cyberspace and provide examples of their impact.},

abstract = {Hackers try to induce malicious content on Facebook. The user is unknown about the characteristic of malicious apps which differ expressively from friendly apps with respect to numerous features. Weka tool is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks which are used to detect and classify the malicious app on Facebook. App-nets are large groups of securely connected applications which are improved using the widely used algorithms. K-means clustering is one such algorithm which is implemented in Weka tool. Security is a major issue for retrieving the clustered data. There is a need to reduce the risk of hackers on Facebook Application. To develop secured business applications Frappe, is used. Frappe is a web information gathering framework to observe the posting behaviour of Facebook app users. Using Frappe for detecting malicious apps and Weka tool for efficient classification, an efficient framework is developed in the proposed system to identify the mischievous Facebook applications.},
