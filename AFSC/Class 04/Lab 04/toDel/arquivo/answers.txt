Lab 01:

O encoding serÃ¡ unicode, provavelmente utf-8 uma vez que nem todos os caracteres usam os 4 bytes

partner number: 0x304C2020
quota: 0x5EBA7242

Considering that parter number is an unsigned int, its value would be 810295328 in big endian encoding and 538987568 in little endian encoding

Considering that the quota is a flot, its value is 6.717437E+18 if big endianness is being used, or 60.682 if little endian is in use.

Considering that the quota is the cost, it would be odd if someone had to pay the value set in the big endian case. Therefore, this file is probably using little endianness.


Lab 02:

All files have the same content, but their sizes are different.

text1.txt -> 99  bytes
text2.txt -> 90  bytes
text3.txt -> 182 bytes
text4.txt -> 364 bytes
text5.txt -> 182 bytes

When we see the files' hexadecimal, it is clear that certain ones have characters with different lengths - that is, each character is encoded using more bytes. This hints that each file is encoded differently.

Running file *.txt this suspicion is confirmed.

text1.txt: UTF-8 Unicode text
text2.txt: ISO-8859 text
text3.txt: Big-endian UTF-16 Unicode text
text4.txt: Unicode text, UTF-32, little-endian
text5.txt: Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text

The encoding that uses the least storage space is, in this case, ISO-8859 text. The encoding that uses the most amount is Unicode text, UTF-32 little endian.

Separate files will be sent in the archive, both have 99bytes

text1.txt, text2-utf8.txt and text4-utf8.txt have the same hash value. This makes sense, as all of these files have utf-8 encoding.

The file messages are all the same. When cat is run on each files, only the ones encoded in utf-8 show all characters correctly.

6) The files have always had the same hash values, and it stayed the same.
