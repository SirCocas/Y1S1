abstract = {Ransomware have observed a steady growth over the years with several concerning trends that indicate efficient, targeted attacks against organizations and individuals alike. These opportunistic attackers indiscriminately target both public and private sector entities to maximize gain. In this article, we highlight the criticality of key management in ransomware's cryptosystem in order to facilitate building effective solutions against this threat. We introduce the ransomware kill chain to elucidate the path our adversaries must take to attain their malicious objective. We examine current solutions presented against ransomware in light of this kill chain and specify which constraints on ransomware are being violated by the existing solutions. Finally, we present the notion of memory attacks against ransomware's key management and present our initial experiments with dynamically extracting decryption keys from real-world ransomware. Results of our preliminary research are promising and the extracted keys were successfully deployed in subsequent data decryption.},

abstract = {The growth of malware poses a major threat to internet users, governments, and businesses around the world. One of the major types of malware, ransomware, encrypts a user's sensitive information and only returns the original files to the user after a ransom is paid. As malware developers shift the delivery of their product from HTTP to HTTPS to protect themselves from payload inspection, we can no longer rely on deep packet inspection to extract features for malware identification. Toward this goal, we propose a solution leveraging a recent trend in networking hardware, that is programmable forwarding engines (PFEs). PFEs allow collection of per-packet, network monitoring data at high rates. We use this data to monitor the network traffic between an infected computer and the command and control (C&C) server. We extract high-level flow features from this traffic and use this data for ransomware classification. We write a stream processor and use a random forest, binary classifier to utilizes these rich flow records in fingerprinting malicious, network activity without the requirement of deep packet inspection. Our classification model achieves a detection rate in excess of 0.86, while maintaining a false negative rate under 0.11. Our results suggest that a flow-based fingerprinting method is feasible and accurate enough to catch ransomware before encryption.},

It is a cyber threat that targets both companies and residential users, and has spread in recent years because of its lucrative results. Several articles have presented classifications of ransomware families and their typical behaviour. These insights have stimulated the creation of detection techniques for antivirus and firewall software. However, because the ransomware scene evolves quickly and aggressively, these studies quickly become outdated. In this study, we surveyed the detection techniques that the research community has developed in recent years. We compared the different approaches and classified the algorithms based on the input data they obtain from ransomware actions, and the decision procedures they use to reach a classification decision between benign or malign applications. This is a detailed survey that focuses on detection algorithms, compared to most previous studies that offer a survey of ransomware families or isolated proposals of detection algorithms. We also compared the results of these proposals.},

abstract = {Ransomware attacks – in contrast to other cyber attacks – must not be detected and especially not blocked or recovered on first sight. This relaxation is supported by the rareness of ransomware attacks. Certainly, the uprising of ransomware families, which are able to circumvent the detection mechanism, integrated into the local machine, prevents the approaches from taking advantage of the relaxation. Justified by the attack isolation, the move to the personal cloud storage is the reasonable way to gain as much as possible of the relaxation, the perfect protection of false positives and the simplified recovery. In this paper we investigate different ransomware families – with the help of realworld malware samples – to formulate a taxonomy of requirements for operation classes and indicator categories. Additionally, we propose an approach which moves the ransomware detection from the local system to the personal cloud storage. Utilizing the file versioning of the cloud storage, we can delay the recovery and reliably perform our content-based, metadata-based and behaviour-based analysis in combination with the ‘guilt by association’ assumption to improve the false positive rate. The new burden for the end-user is the responsibility of supervising the recovery; but the responsibilities are supported by the simplified recovery – offering the classification information – allowing the user to make a qualified decision and release the user from fighting with false classified operations. In summary, this leads to an improvement in the aspects of detection quality, usability and reliable recovery.},

abstract = {Ransomwares have become a growing threat since 2012, and the situation continues to worsen until now. The lack of security mechanisms and security awareness are pushing the systems into mire of ransomware attacks. In this paper, a new framework called 2entFOX' is proposed in order to detect high survivable ransomwares (HSR). To our knowledge this framework can be considered as one of the first frameworks in ransomware detection because of little publicly-available research in this field. We analyzed Windows ransomwares' behaviour and we tried to find appropriate features which are particular useful in detecting this type of malwares with high detection accuracy and low false positive rate. After hard experimental analysis we extracted 20 effective features which due to two highly efficient ones we could achieve an appropriate set for HSRs detection. After proposing architecture based on Bayesian belief network, the final evaluation is done on some known ransomware samples and unknown ones based on six different scenarios. The result of this evaluations shows the high accuracy of 2entFox in detection of HSRs.},

abstract = {Abstract Ransomware has become a pandemic nowadays. Although some proposals exist to fight against this increasing type of extortion, most of them are prevention like and rely on the assumption that early detection is not so effective once the victim is infected. This paper presents a novel approach intended not just to early detect ransomware but to completely thwart its action. For that, a set of honeyfiles is deployed around the target environment in order to catch the ransomware. Instead of being normal archives, honeyfiles are FIFO like, so that the ransomware is blocked once it starts reading the file. In addition to frustrate its action, our honeyfile solution is able to automatically launch countermeasures to solve the infection. Moreover, as it does not require previous training or knowledge, the approach allows fighting against unknown, zero-day ransomware related attacks. As a proof of concept, we have developed the approach for Linux platforms. The tool, named R-Locker , shows excellent performance both from the perspective of its accuracy as well as in terms of complexity and resource consumption. In addition, it has no special needs or privileges and does not affect the normal operation of the overall environment.},

abstract = {We present a low-overhead ransomware-proof SSD, called Ran-somBlocker (RBlocker). RBlocker provides 100% full protections against all possible ransomware attacks by delaying every data deletion until no attack is guaranteed. To reduce storage overheads of the delayed deletion, RBlocker employs a time-out based backup policy. Based on the fact that ransomware must store encrypted version of target files, early deletions of obsolete data are allowed if no encrypted write was detected for a short interval. Otherwise, RBlocker keeps the data for an interval long enough to guarantee no attack condition. For an accurate in-line detection of encrypted writes, we leverages entropy-and CNN-based detectors in an integrated fashion. Our experimental results show that RBlocker can defend all types of ransomware attacks with negligible overheads.

abstract = {Abstract Crypto ransomware is a type of malware that locks access to user files by encrypting them and demands a ransom in order to obtain the decryption key. This type of malware has become a serious threat for most enterprises. In those cases where the infected computer has access to documents in network shared volumes, a single host can lock access to documents across several departments in the company. We propose an algorithm that can detect ransomware action and prevent further activity over shared documents. The algorithm is based on the analysis of passively monitored traffic by a network probe. 19 different ransomware families were used for testing the algorithm in action. The results show that it can detect ransomware activity in less than 20 s, before more than 10 files are lost. Recovery of even those files was also possible because their content was stored in the traffic monitored by the network probe. Several days of traffic from real corporate networks were used to validate a low rate of false alarms. This paper offers also analytical models for the probability of early detection and the probability of false alarms for an arbitrarily large population of users.},

abstract = {Ransomware attacks have become prevalent nowadays due to sudden flourish of cryptocurrencies. Most existing defense strategies for ransomware, however, are vulnerable to privileged ransomware who can compromise the operating system and hence any backup data stored locally. The out-of-place-update and the isolation nature of flash memory storage, for the first time, makes it possible to design a defense strategy which is secure against the privileged ransomware. In this work, we propose MimosaFTL, a secure and practical ransomware defense strategy for mobile computing devices equipped with flash memory as external storage. MimosaFTL is secure against the privileged malware by taking advantage of unique characteristics of flash storage. In addition, it is more practical (compared to prior work) for real-world deployments by: 1) incorporating a fine-grained detection scheme which can detect presence of ransomware accurately; and 2) allowing the victim to efficiently restore the infected external storage to the exact point when the malware starts to perform corruption. Experimental evaluation shows that, MimosaFTL can mitigate ransomware attacks effectively with a small negative impact on both I/O performance and lifetime of flash storage.},

abstract = {Traditional techniques to prevent damage from ransomware attacks are to detect and block attacks by monitoring the known behaviors such as frequent name changes, recurring access to cryptographic libraries and exchange keys with remote servers. Unfortunately, intelligent ransomware can easily bypass these techniques. Another prevention technique is to recover from the backup copy when a file is infected with ransomware. However, the data backup technique requires extra storage space and can be removed with ransomware. In this paper, we propose to implement an access control mechanism on a disk drive, called a KEY-SSD disk drive. KEY-SSD is the data store and the last barrier to data protection. Unauthorized applications will not be able to read file data even if they bypass the file system defense, thus denying the block request without knowing the disk's registered block key and completely eliminating the possibility of the file becoming hostage to ransomware. We have prototyped KEY-SSD and validated the usefulness of KEY-SSD by demonstrating 1) selective block access control, 2) unauthorized data access blocking and 3) negligible performance overhead. Our comprehensive evaluation of KEY-SSD for various workloads show the KEY-SSD performance is hardly degraded due to OS lightweight key transmission and access control drive optimization. We also confirmed that KEY-SSD successfully protects the files in the actual ransomware sample.},

abstract = {Encryption ransomware is a malicious software that stealthily encrypts user files and demands a ransom to provide access to these files. Several prior studies have developed systems to detect ransomware by monitoring the activities that typically occur during a ransomware attack. Unfortunately, by the time the ransomware is detected, some files already undergo encryption and the user is still required to pay a ransom to access those files. Furthermore, ransomware variants can obtain kernel privilege, which allows them to terminate software-based defense systems, such as anti-virus. While periodic backups have been explored as a means to mitigate ransomware, such backups incur storage overheads and are still vulnerable as ransomware can obtain kernel privilege to stop or destroy backups. Ideally, we would like to defend against ransomware without relying on software-based solutions and without incurring the storage overheads of backups. To that end, this paper proposes FlashGuard, a ransomware tolerant Solid State Drive (SSD) which has a firmware-level recovery system that allows quick and effective recovery from encryption ransomware without relying on explicit backups. FlashGuard leverages the observation that the existing SSD already performs out-of-place writes in order to mitigate the long erase latency of flash memories. Therefore, when a page is updated or deleted, the older copy of that page is anyway present in the SSD. FlashGuard slightly modifies the garbage collection mechanism of the SSD to retain the copies of the data encrypted by ransomware and ensure effective data recovery. Our experiments with 1,447 manually labeled ransomware samples show that FlashGuard can efficiently restore files encrypted by ransomware. In addition, we demonstrate that FlashGuard has a negligible impact on the performance and lifetime of the SSD.},

abstract = {Ransomware is one of growing concerns in enterprise and government organizations, because it may cause financial damages or loss of important data. Although there are techniques to detect and prevent ransomware, an evolved ransomware may evade them because they are based on monitoring known behaviors. Ransomware can be mitigated if backup copies of data are retained in a safe place. However, existing backup solutions may be under ransomware's control and an intelligent ransomware may destroy backup copies too. They also incur overhead to storage space, performance and network traffic (in case of remote backup). In this paper, we propose an SSD system that supports automated backup, called Amoeba. In particular, Amoeba is armed with a hardware accelerator that can detect the infection of pages by ransomware attacks at high speed and a fine-grained backup control mechanism to minimize space overhead for original data backup. For evaluation, we extended the Microsoft SSD simulator to implement Amoeba and evaluated it using the realistic block-level traces, which are collected while running the actual ransomware. According to our experiments, Amoeba has negligible overhead and outperforms in performance and space efficiency over the state-of-the-art SSD, FlashGuard, which supports data backup within the device.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to a victim’s computing resources and demands a ransom in order to restore access. This is a continually growing and costly threat across the globe, therefore efforts have been made both in academia and industry to develop techniques that can help to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of Windows-based anti-ransomware tools and techniques, using a clear, simple and consistent terminology in terms of Data Sources, Processing and Actions. We extensively analysed relevant literature so that, to the best of our knowledge, we had at the time covered all approaches taken to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. We grouped these techniques according to their main features as a way to understand the landscape. We then selected 15 existing anti-ransomware tools both to examine how they fit into this landscape and to compare them by aggregating their accuracy and overhead – two of the most important selection criteria of these tools – as reported by the tools’ respective authors. We were able to determine popular solutions and unexplored gaps that could lead to promising areas of anti-ransomware development. From there, we propose two novel detection techniques, namely serial byte correlation and edit distance. This paper serves as a much needed roadmap of knowledge and ideas to systematise the current landscape of anti-ransomware tools.},

abstract = {Ransomware has recently (re)emerged as a popular malware that targets a wide range of victims - from individual users to corporate ones for monetary gain. Our key observation on the existing ransomware detection mechanisms is that they fail to provide an early warning in real-time which results in irreversible encryption of a significant number of files while the post-encryption techniques (e.g., key extraction, file restoration) suffer from several limitations. Also, the existing detection mechanisms result in high false positives being unable to determine the original intent of file changes, i.e., they fail to distinguish whether a significant change in a file is due to a ransomware encryption or due to a file operation by the user herself (e.g., benign encryption or compression). To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a ransomware detection mechanism, RWGuard, which is able to detect crypto-ransomware in real-time on a user’s machine by (1) deploying decoy techniques, (2) carefully monitoring both the running processes and the file system for malicious activities, and (3) omitting benign file changes from being flagged through the learning of users’ encryption behavior. We evaluate our system against samples from 14 most prevalent ransomware families to date. Our experiments show that RWGuard is effective in real-time detection of ransomware with zero false negative and negligible false positive (\(\sim \)0.1%) rates while incurring an overhead of only \(\sim \)1.9%.},

However, there are undeniable similarities between ransomware and other types of malware attacks. Hence, the two main questions that are often asked are: What are the challenges in defending against ransomware that can be solved using existing malware detection techniques? And, what are the new intellectual challenges that require developing new tools and techniques? In this article, we summarize some of the challenges in developing anti-ransomware solutions by considering the similarities and differences between ransomware and other types of malware attacks.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a malware that encrypts victim's data, where the decryption key is released after a ransom is paid by the data owner to the attacker. Many ransomware attacks were reported recently, making anti-ransomware a crucial need in security operation, and an issue for the security community to tackle. In this paper, we propose a new approach to defending against ransomware inside NAND flash-based SSDs. To realize the idea of defense-inside-SSDs, both a lightweight detection technique and a perfect recovery algorithm to be used as a part of SSDs firmware should be developed. To this end, we propose a new set of lightweight behavioral features on ran-somware's overwriting pattern, which are invariant across various ransomwares. Our features rely on observing the block I/O request headers only, and not the payload. For perfect and instant recovery, we also propose using the delayed deletion feature of SSDs, which is intrinsic to NAND flash. To demonstrate their feasibility, we implement our algorithms atop an open-channel SSD as a working prototype called SSD-Insider. In experiments using eight real-world and two in-house ransomwares with various background applications running, SSD-Insider achieved a detection accuracy 0% FRR/FAR in most scenarios, and only 5% FAR when heavy overwriting resembling ransomware's data wiping occurs. SSD-Insider detects ransomware activity within 10s, and recovers instantly an infected SSD within 1s with 0% data loss. The additional software overheads incurred by the SSD-Insider is just 147 ns and 254 ns for 4-KB reads and writes, respectively, which is negligible considering NAND chip latency (50-1000 µs).},

abstract = {In the last decade, crypto-ransomware evolved from a family of malicious software with scarce repercussion in the research community, to a sophisticated and highly effective intrusion method positioned in the spotlight of the main organizations for cyberdefense. Its modus operandi is characterized by fetching the assets to be blocked, their encryption, and triggering an extortion process that leads the victim to pay for the key that allows their recovery. This paper reviews the evolution of crypto-ransomware focusing on the implication of the different advances in communication technologies that empowered its popularization. In addition, a novel defensive approach based on the Self-Organizing Network paradigm and the emergent communication technologies (e.g. Software-Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, Cloud Computing, etc.) is proposed. They enhance the orchestration of smart defensive deployments that adapt to the status of the monitoring environment and facilitate the adoption of previously defined risk management policies. In this way it is possible to efficiently coordinate the efforts of sensors and actuators distributed throughout the protected environment without supervision by human operators, resulting in greater protection with increased viability},

In this paper, we analyze existing decoy strategies and discuss how they are effective in countering current ransomware by defining a set of metrics to measure their robustness. To demonstrate how ransomware can identify existing deception-based detection strategies, we have implemented a proof-of-concept anti-decoy ransomware that successfully bypasses decoys by using a decision engine with few rules. Finally, we discuss existing issues in decoy-based strategies and propose practical solutions to mitigate them.},

As the most harmful variant of ransomware crypto-ransomware encrypts the victim's valuable data, and asks for ransom money. Paying the ransom money, however, may not guarantee recovery of the data being encrypted. Most of the existing work for ransomware defense purely focuses on ransomware detection. A few of them consider data recovery from ransomware attacks, but they are not able to defend against ransomware which can obtain a high system privilege. In this work, we design RDS3, a novel Ransomware Defense Strategy, in which we Stealthily back up data in the Spare space of a computing device, such that the data encrypted by ransomware can be restored. Our key idea is that the spare space which stores the backup data is fully isolated from the ransomware. In this way, the ransomware is not able to “touch” the backup data regardless of what privilege it can obtain. Security analysis and experimental evaluation show that RDS3 can mitigate ransomware attacks with an acceptable overhead.},

However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called “Peeler” (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware’s inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system’s kernel events and detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that Peeler achieves more than 99% detection rate with 0.58% false-positive rate against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto and screen-locker types of ransomware. For crypto ransomware, Peeler detects them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average). Peeler utilizes around 4.9% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the normal workload condition. Our analysis demonstrates that Peeler can efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level events.},

By running instances of this type of ransomware in a test environment, we analyze their behavior, especially in the DNS traffic segment, which leads us to derive several behavioral characteristics. Among these features, we can point to ”random and gibberish characters” in the requested domains; But using this feature is not easy as it can yield a lot of false positives. Our new and innovative approach to solving this challenge is to measure “Frequency of Different Domains Generation” and “Repetition of Same Domains in a Time Interval”. With the help of these criteria, we show that our method is more effective. The proposed approach can be used to detect botnets and other DGA-based malwares. Moreover, our approach detects ransomwares in their early phase of activity (i.e., before encrypting user data). Ultimately, we propose these features as a framework for identifying these ransomwares with high detection accuracy and low false positives rate.},

We show how the move to personal cloud storage allows for a paradigm shift in ransomware protection: exceptional attack isolation, perfect elimination of false positive alerts, and simplified recovery. In this paper, we analyze the necessary operations for ransomware, extend existing ransomware taxonomy, and verify them against real-world malware samples. We analyze the costs and benefits of moving ransomware detection to versioned personal cloud storage. Our content, meta data, and behavior analysis paired with a ‘guilt by association’ capability greatly improve the false positive rate, but the guided undo make this rate all but inconsequential.

abstract = {We present the Malware - O - Matic analysis platform and the Data Aware Defense ransomware countermeasure based on real time data gathering with as little impact as possible on system performance. Our solution monitors (and blocks if necessary) file system activity of all userland threads with new indicators of compromise. We successfully detect 99.37% of our 798 active ransomware samples with at most 70 MB lost per sample’s thread in 90% of cases, or less than 7 MB in 70% of cases. By a careful analysis of the few false negatives we show that some ransomware authors are specifically trying to hide ongoing encryption. We used free (as in free beer) de facto industry standard benchmarks to evaluate the impact of our solution and enable fair comparisons. In all but the most demanding tests the impact is marginal.},
