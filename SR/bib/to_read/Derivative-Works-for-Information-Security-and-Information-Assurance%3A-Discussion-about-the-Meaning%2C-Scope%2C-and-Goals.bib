abstract = {This article focuses on identifying key human resource management (HRM) practices necessary for improving information security performance from the perspective of IT professionals. The Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) via SmartPLS 3.0 was employed and 232 samples were collected from information technology (IT) professionals in 43 organizations. The analysis identified information security training, background checks and monitoring as very important HRM practices that could improve the performance of organizational information security. In particular, the study found training on mobile devices security and malware; background checks and monitoring of potential, current and former employees as of high importance but with low performance. Thus, these key areas need to be improved with top priority. Conversely, the study found accountability and employee relations as being overly emphasized by the organisations. The findings raised some useful implications and information for HR and IT leaders to consider in future information security strategy.},

abstract = {The main contribution of this thesis is Secure*BPMN, a graphical security modelling extension for the de-facto industry standard business process modelling language BPMN 2.0.1. Secure*BPMN enables a cognitively effective representation of security concerns in business process models. It facilitates the engagement of experts with different backgrounds, including non-security and nontechnical experts, in the discussion of security concerns and in security decision-making. The strength and novelty of Secure*BPMN lie in its comprehensive semantics based on a Reference Model of Information Assurance & Security (RMIAS) and in its cognitively effective syntax. 
The RMIAS, which was developed in this project, is a synthesis of the existing knowledge of the Information Assurance & Security domain. The RMIAS helps to build an agreed-upon understanding of Information Assurance & Security, which experts with different backgrounds require before they may proceed with the discussion of security issues. The development process of the RMIAS, which was made explicit, and the multiphase evaluation carried out confirmed the completeness and accuracy of the RMIAS, and its suitability as a foundation for the semantics of Secure*BPMN. The RMIAS, which has multiple implications for research, education and practice is a secondary contribution of this thesis, and is a contribution to the Information Assurance & Security domain in its own right. 
The syntax of Secure*BPMN complies with the BPMN extensibility rules and with the scientific principles of cognitively effective notation design. The analytical and empirical evaluations corroborated the ontological completeness, cognitive effectiveness, ease of use and usefulness of Secure*BPMN. It was verified that Secure*BPMN has a potential to be adopted in practice.},

abstract = {Business processes are essential instruments used for the coordination of organisational activities in order to produce value in the form of products and services. Information security is an important non-functional characteristic of business processes due to the involvement of sensitive data exchanged between their participants. Therefore, potential security shortfalls can severely impact organisational reputation, customer trust and cause compliance issues. Nevertheless, despite its importance, security is often considered as a technical concern and treated as an afterthought during the design of information systems and the business processes which they support. The consideration of security during the early design stages of information systems is highly beneficial. Goal-oriented security requirements engineering approaches can contribute to the early elicitation of system requirements at a high level of abstraction and capture the organisational context and rationale behind design choices. Aligning such requirements with process activities at the operational level augments the traceability between system models of different abstraction levels and leads to more robust and context-aware operationalisations of security. Therefore, there needs to be a well-defined and verifiable interconnection between a system’s security requirements and its business process models. This work introduces a framework for the design of secure business process models. It uses security-oriented goal models as its starting point to capture a socio-technical view of the system to-be and its security requirements during its early design stages. Concept mappings and model transformation rules are also introduced as a structured way of extracting business process skeletons from such goal models, in order to facilitate the alignment between the two different levels of abstraction. The extracted business process skeletons, are refined to complete business process models through the use of a set of security patterns, which standardise proven solutions to recurring security problems. Finally, the framework also offers security verification capabilities of the produced process models through the introduction of security-related attributes and model checking algorithms. Evaluation of this work is performed: (i) through individual evaluation of its components via their application in real-life systems, (ii) a workshop-based modelling exercise where participants used and evaluated parts of the framework and (iii) a case study from the public administration domain where the overall framework was applied in cooperation with stakeholders of the studied system. The evaluation indicated that the developed framework provides a structured ap-},

abstract = {Business process modelling is one of the major aspects in the modern information system development. Recently business process model and notation BPMN has become a standard technique to support this activity. Typically the BPMN notations are used to understand enterprise's business processes. However, limited work exists regarding how security concerns are addressed during the management of the business processes. This is a problem, since both business processes and security should be understood in parallel to support a development of the secure information systems. In the previous work we have analysed BPMN with respect to the domain model of the IS security risk management ISSRM and showed how the language constructs could be aligned to the concepts of the ISSRM domain model. In this paper the authors propose the BPMN extensions for security risk management based on the BPMN alignment to the ISSRM concepts. We illustrate how the extended BPMN could express assets, risks and risk treatment on few running examples related to the Internet store regarding the asset confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our proposal would allow system analysts to understand how to develop security requirements to secure important assets defined through business processes. The paper opens the possibility for business and security model interoperability and the model transformation between several modelling approaches if these both are aligned to the ISSRM domain model.},

abstract = {Information systems (IS’s) support a multitude of functions vital to the modern society. IS’s carry an ever increasing volume of data and information, including personal pictures, health data or financial transactions. Continuously increasing rates of cyber-attacks have led to the subsequent need to rapidly develop secure IS. To develop secure IS’s, security goals need to be identified and fulfilled accordingly. Goal-oriented development fulfils the achievement of security goal by providing a methodology that enables security requirement elicitation throughout the entire development of an information system. This is achieved by considering every component of a system as an actor that is driven by goals that the actor strives to achieve. Nevertheless goal-oriented modeling has proven itself to be valid it maintains multiple shortcomings. The main disadvantage lays in the high granularity of the process making it complex very fast and subsequently raising the level of complexity of the overall process. Therefore a structured approach that would provide a step-by-step guide throughout the application of the process would be essential. Security patterns are proven to be reusable solutions that address recurring security problems which are commonly faced during the process of software development. In this master thesis we investigate the integration of a pattern based security requirement elicitation process in the goal-oriented IS development. By performing this integration we aim at providing a process that enables the elicitation of security requirements from Security Risk-aware Secure Tropos (RAST) models. RAST is a security goal-oriented modeling language that is applicable throughout the complete process of software development from early to late requirements, architecture, detailed design and final implementation. The contribution of this thesis are five Security Risk-aware Patterns expressed using RAST. The thesis outlines the steps to be executed to apply the proposed security patterns. We validated our contribution by performing a case study that confirmed the overall usability of our proposed patterns and the pattern application process. Additionally the case study determined that the provided patterns can be used as a starting point for a faster and more efficient in identifying security requirements.},

abstract = {Digital forensic investigation is a complex and time-consuming activity in response to a cybersecurity incident or cybercrime to answer questions related to it. These typically are what happened, when, where, how, and who is responsible. However, answering them is often very laborious and sometimes outright impossible due to a lack of useable data. The forensic-ready software systems are designed to produce valuable on-point data for use in the investigation with potentially high evidence value. Still, the particular ways to develop these systems are currently not explored. This paper proposes consideration of forensic readiness within security risk management to refine specific requirements on forensic-ready software systems. The idea is to re-evaluate the taken security risk decisions with the aim to provide trustable data when the security measures fail. Additionally, it also considers possible disputes, which the digital evidence can solve. Our proposed approach, risk-oriented forensic-ready design, composes of two parts: (1) process guiding the identification of the requirements in the form of potential evidence sources, and (2) supporting BPMN notation capturing the potential evidence sources and their relationship. Together they are aimed to provide a high-level overview of the forensic-ready requirements within the system. Finally, the approach is demonstrated on an automated valet parking scenario, followed by a discussion regarding its impact and usefulness within the forensic readiness effort.},
