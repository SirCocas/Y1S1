abstract = {In this paper we present a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the following problem: given a non-zero polynomial fe Q(X) in one variable with rational coefficients, find the decomposition of f into irreducible factors in Q(X). It is well known that this is equivalent to factoring primitive polynomials feZ(X) into irreducible factors in Z(X). Here we call f~ Z(X) primitive if the greatest common divisor of its coefficients (the content of f) is 1. Our algorithm performs well in practice, cf. (8). Its running time, measured in bit operations, is O(nl2+n9(log(fD3).},

abstract = {An alternative technique for finding small roots of univariate modular equations is described. This approach is then compared with that taken in (Coppersmith, 1996), which links the concept of the dual lattice (see (Cassels, 1971)) to the LLL algorithm (see (Lenstra et al., 1982)). Timing results comparing both algorithms are given, and practical considerations are discussed. This work has direct applications to several low exponent attacks on the RSA cryptographic scheme (see (Coppersmith, 1996)).},

abstract = {A cryptanalytic attack on the use of short RSA secret exponents is described. The attack makes use of an algorithm based on continued fractions that finds the numerator and denominator of a fraction in polynomial time when a close enough estimate of the fraction is known. The public exponent e and the modulus pq can be used to create an estimate of a fraction that involves the secret exponent d. The algorithm based on continued fractions uses this estimate to discover sufficiently short secret exponents. For a typical case where e>pq, GCD(p-1, q-1) is small, and p and q have approximately the same number of bits, this attack will discover secret exponents with up to approximately one-quarter as may bits as the modulus. Ways to combat this attack, ways to improve it, and two open problems are described. This attack poses no threat to the normal case of RSA where the secret exponent is approximately the same size as the modulus. This is because the attack uses information provided by the public exponent and, in the normal case, the public exponent can be chosen almost independently of the modulus. >},

We give two applications to RSA encryption with exponent 3. First, knowledge of all the ciphertext and 2/3 of the plaintext bits for a single message reveals that message. Second, if messages are padded with truly random padding and then encrypted with an exponent 3, then two encryptions of the same message (with different padding) will reveal the message, as long as the padding is less than 1/9 of the length of N. With several encryptions, another technique can (heuristically) tolerate padding up to about 1/6 of the length of N.},

abstract = {In 1998, Boneh, Durfee and Frankel [4] presented several attacks on RSA when an adversary knows a fraction of the secret key bits. The motivation for these so-called partial key exposure attacks mainly arises from the study of side-channel attacks on RSA. With side channel attacks an adversary gets either most significant or least significant bits of the secret key. The polynomial time algorithms given in [4] only work provided that the public key e is smaller than N. It was raised as an open question whether there are polynomial time attacks beyond this bound. We answer this open question in the present work both in the case of most and least significant bits. Our algorithms make use of Coppersmith's heuristic method for solving modular multivariate polynomial equations [8]. For known most significant bits, we provide an algorithm that works for public exponents e in the interval [N, N 0.725 ]. Surprisingly, we get an even stronger result for known least significant bits: An algorithm that works for all e < N. We also provide partial key exposure attacks on fast RSA-variants that use Chinese Remaindering in the decryption process (e.g. [20,21]). These fast variants are interesting for time-critical applications like smart-cards which in turn are highly vulnerable to side-channel attacks. The new attacks are provable. We show that for small public exponent RSA half of the bits of dp = d mod p- 1 suffice to find the factorization of N in polynomial time. This amount is only a quarter of the bits of N and therefore the method belongs to the strongest known partial key exposure attacks.},
