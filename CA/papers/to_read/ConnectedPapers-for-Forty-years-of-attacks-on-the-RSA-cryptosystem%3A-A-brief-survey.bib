abstract = {Abstract RSA public key cryptosystem is the de-facto standard use in worldwide technologies as a strong encryption/decryption and digital signature scheme. RSA successfully defended forty years of attack since invention. In this study we survey, its past, present advancements and upcoming challenges that needs concrete analysis and as a counter measure against possible threats according to underlying algebraic structure. Past studies shows us some attacks on RSA by inspecting flaws on relax model using weak public/private keys, integer factorization problem, and some specific low parameter selection attacks. Such flaws can not hamper the security of RSA cryptosystem by at large, but can explore possible vulnerabilities for more deep understanding about underlying mathematics and improper parameter selection. We describe a brief survey of past findings and detail description about specific attacks. A comprehensive survey of known attacks on RSA cryptosystem shows us that a well implemented algorithm is unbreakable and it survived against a number of cryptanalytic attacks since last forty years.},

In this paper we propose a special case of Boneh-Durfee’s attack with respect to large private exponent (i.e. d = N > e = N where and α are the private and public key exponents respectively) for some α ≤ , which satisfy the condition d > φ(N) −N . We analyzed lattices whose basis matrices are triangular and non-triangular using large decryption exponent and focus group attacks respectively. The core objective is to explore RSA polynomials underlying algebraic structure so that we can improve the performance of weak key attacks.

Since its invention, Coppersmith’s method has become an important tool in the cryptanalysis of RSA crypto algorithm and its variants. In 2006, Jochemsz and May introduced a general strategy to solve small roots of any form of multivariate modular equations in polynomial time. Based on Jochemsz–May’s strategy, for any given multivariate equations one can easily construct the desired lattices with triangular matrix basis. However, for some attacks, Jochemsz–May’s general strategy could not fully capture the algebraic structure of the target polynomials. Thus, some sophisticated techniques that can deeply exploit the algebraic relations have been proposed. In this paper, we give a survey of these recent approaches for lattice constructions, and also give small examples to show how these approaches work.},

In this paper, we further raise the security boundary of the Zhao-Qi attack by considering another polynomial. Our improvemet supports the result of analogue Fermat factoring on LSBS-RSA, which claims that p and q cannot share more than $\frac{n}{4}$ least significant bits, where n is the bit-length of pq . In conclusion, it is a trade-off between the number of sharing bits and the security level in LSBS-RSA. One should be more careful when using LSBS-RSA with short exponents.},

abstract = {Die vorliegende Dissertationsschrift beschäftigt sich mit dem heutzutage bekanntesten und meistverwendeten Public-Key Kryptosystem; dem 1978 von Rivest, Shamir und Adleman vorgeschlagenen RSA-Kryptosystem. Es wird gezeigt, dass spezielle Parameterwahlen bei diesem Kryptosystem zu Polynomialzeit-Angriffen führen. Betrachten wir dazu die Generierung der RSA-Parameter genauer: Man wählt zwei große Primzahlen p und q und berechnet deren Produkt N = pq. Der sogenannte RSAModul N ist öffentlich, wohingegen die Faktorisierung von N in p und q geheim ist. Weiterhin wählt man ein Schlüsselpaar (e, d) mit der Eigenschaft ed = 1 mod (p − 1)(q − 1). Hierbei ist der Parameter e bei RSA öffentlich bekannt, und der Parameter d ist geheim. Der geheime Schlüssel d kann leicht aus (N, e) berechnet werden, falls man die Faktorisierung von N kennt. Daher kann ein Angreifer versuchen, die Faktorisierung von N zu bestimmen. Es ist aber bisher kein Algorithmus bekannt, der die Faktorisierung von N in polynomieller Zeit in der Bitlänge von N berechnet. Die vorliegende Arbeit zeigt, dass ein Angreifer die Faktorisierung in polynomieller Zeit finden kann, falls e eine spezielle Form hat oder der Angreifer in den Besitz eines Bruchteils der Bits des geheimen Schlüssels d gelangt. Als Methode wird in der Arbeit ein von Coppersmith 1996 vorgestellter Algorithmus zum Bestimmen kleiner Nullstellen modularer Polynomgleichungen verwendet und weiterentwickelt.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the condition of finding small solutions (x, y, z) = (x0, y0, z0) of the equation Bx−Ay = z. The framework is derived from Wiener’s small private exponent attack on RSA and May-Ritzenhofen’s investigation about the implicit factorization problem, both of which can be generalized to solve the above equation. We show that these two methods, together with Coppersmith’s method, are equivalent for solving Bx − Ay = z in the general case. Then based on Coppersmith’s method, we present two improvements for solving Bx − Ay = z in some special cases. The first improvement pays attention to the case where either gcd(x0, z0, A) or gcd(y0, z0, B) is large enough. As the applications of this improvement, we propose some new cryptanalysis of RSA, such as new results about the generalized implicit factorization problem, attacks with known bits of the prime factor, and so on. The motivation of these applications comes from oracle based complexity of factorization problems. The second improvement assumes that the value of C ≡ z0 (mod x0) is known. We present two attacks on RSA as its applications. One focuses on the case with known bits of the private exponent together with the prime factor, and the other considers the case with a small difference of the two prime factors. Our new attacks on RSA improve the previous corresponding results respectively, and the correctness of the approach is verified by experiments.},

abstract = {We show a relation between optimal bounds of a small inverse problem and an approximate GCD problem. First, we present a lattice based method to solve small inverse problems with higher degree. The problem is a natural extension of small secret exponent attack on RSA cryptosystem introduced by Boneh and Durfee. They reduced this attack to solving a bivariate modular equation: $x(A+y) \equiv 1 \pmod{e}$, where A is a given integer and e is a public exponent. They proved that the problem can be solved in polynomial time when d≤N0.292. In this paper, we extend the Boneh---Durfee's result to more general problem. For a monic polynomial h(y) of degree κ(≥1), integers C and e, we want to find all small roots of a bivariate modular equation: $xh(y)+C \equiv 0 \pmod{e}$. We denote by X and Y the upper bound of roots. We present an algorithm for solving the problem and prove that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if $\gamma \leq 1-\sqrt{\kappa \alpha}$ and |C| is small enough, where X=eγ and Y=eα. We employ a similar approach as unravelled linearization technique introduced by Herrmann and May in especially evaluating the lattice volume. Interestingly, our algorithm does not rule out the case of C=0, which implies that our algorithm can solve a univariate unknown modular equation $h(y) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$, where p is unknown. Our algorithm achieves the best bound in the literature. Then, we show that our obtained bound is natural under the similar sense of Howgrave-Graham's discussion in CaLC2001 and we prove that our bound, including Boneh---Durfee's bound, is optimal under the reasonable assumption.},

For example, given an integer N = p q , which is a product of two primes, it is hard to determine the prime factors p and q efficiently. However, for the suitable size of a number N , Fermat's algorithm may be one of the simplest method for solving it. In this paper, a method called EPF for estimating the prime factors of a composite number is proposed. We use the technique of continued fractions to output two integers, p E + q E and p E ? q E , which are close to p + q and p ? q , respectively. Furthermore, we show that EPF can be adopted to reduce the loop count in Fermat's algorithm before factoring a composite number. The effect depends on the size of the prime factor. We believe that there are still other applications as well wherein EPF can be used.

Boneh and Durfee reduced the attack into finding small roots of a bivariate modular equation: $x(N+1+y)+1 \equiv 0 (\bmod\; e)$ , where N is an RSA moduli and e is the RSA public key. Boneh and Durfee proposed a lattice based algorithm for solving the problem. When the secret exponent d is less than N0.292, their method breaks RSA scheme. Since the lattice used in the analysis is not full-rank, the analysis is not easy. Blomer and May gave an alternative algorithm. Although their bound d≤N0.290 is worse than Boneh---Durfee result, their method used a full rank lattice. However, the proof for their bound is still complicated. Herrmann and May gave an elementary proof for the Boneh---Durfee's bound: d≤N0.292. In this paper, we first give an elementary proof for achieving the bound of Blomer---May: d≤N0.290. Our proof employs unravelled linearization technique introduced by Herrmann and May and is rather simpler than Blomer---May's proof.

As an example, the RSA system with d of 192 bits, p of 256 bits, and q of 768 bits is secure against all the existing short secret exponent attacks. Besides, in order to balance and minimize the overall computations between encryption and decryption, we propose a variant of RSA such that both e and d are of the same size, e.g., log 2 e ≃ log 2 d ≃ 568 for a 1024-bit RSA modulus. Moreover, a generalization of this variant is presented to design the RSA system with log 2 e+log 2 d ≃ log 2 N+l k where l k is a predetermined constant, c.g., 112.

abstract = {The purpose of this diploma thesis is the study both of the mathematical background on lattice theory and of the corresponding applications to the RSA Cryptosystem. In bibliography, there are two quite di erent mathematical structures that are usually called lattices. The rst one has to do with partially ordered sets while the other has to do with regular arrangements of points in space. In this thesis we exclusively consider the second case. Historically, lattices were investigated since the late 18th century by mathematicians such as Lagrange and Gauss. In the 19th century, important results due to Minkowski motivated the use of lattice theory in the theory and geometry of numbers. The evolution of computer science in the 20th century led to lattice applications in various theoretical areas such as factorization of integer polynomials, integer programming and Public-Key Cryptography. In the latter area, lattice theory has played a crucial role in the de nition of new cryptosystems, in the study of cryptographic primitives and in cryptanalysis. The main goal of a cryptosystem is to guarantee the exchange of information between the legitimate sender and the legitimate receivers, ensuring at the same time, that any unauthorized party is unable to recover part of the information. In the thesis in hand, we focus exclusively on RSA Cryptosystem, which is probably the most wide-spread Public-Key Cryptosystem. Since its publication, in 1977, RSA has been used in plenty of applications ranging from digital signatures to electronic credit-card payment systems. After almost 30 years of existence, RSA has been extensively analyzed for vulnerabilities by many researchers. In the rst chapter we give some basic background on lattices while, in the second, we introduce the notion of lattice basis reduction with emphasis to LLL reduction and the corresponding algorithm. The third chapter describes the use of lattices in nding small roots to polynomial equations. In the fourth chapter, we present RSA and a positive lattice related application to it. Finally, in the fth chapter, we present an overview of the most representative lattice-based attacks mounted against RSA since its publication.},

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate that there exist weak keys in the RSA public-key cryptosystem with the public exponent e = Nα ≤ N0.5. In 1999, Boneh and Durfee showed that when α ≈ 1 and the private exponent d = Nβ < N0.292, the system is insecure. Moreover, their attack is still effective for 0.5 < α < 1.875. We propose a generalized cryptanalytic method to attack the RSA cryptosystem with α ≤ 0.5. For $$c = \left\lfloor {\frac{{1 - \alpha }}{\alpha }} \right\rfloor $$ and eγc ≡ d (mod ec), when γ, β satisfy $$\gamma < 1 + \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{{2\alpha c}}and\beta < \alpha c + \frac{7}{6} - \alpha \gamma c - \frac{1}{3}\sqrt {6\alpha + 6\alpha c + 1 - 6\alpha \gamma c} $$, we can perform cryptanalytic attacks based on the LLL algorithm. The basic idea is an application of Coppersmith’s techniques and we further adapt the technique of unravelled linearization, which leads to an optimized lattice. Our advantage is that we achieve new attacks on RSA with α ≤ 0.5 and consequently, there exist weak keys in RSA for most α.摘要创新点本文分析了RSA算法中当公钥e小于等于N的0.5次幂时可能存在的弱密钥攻击。一方面, 改进了之前当d大于e时的攻击方法, 提出了可以用于分析e小于等于N的0.5次幂时的广义攻击。另一方面, 应用展开线性化的技巧, 进一步提出了基于优化的格构造方法下的广义攻击。既可以缩小格的维数, 减少LLL算法的运行时间, 也可以提高理论分析中私钥d应满足的上界。与之前已有的攻击方法对比可以看出, 我们的方法不仅扩大了e的适用范围, 也提高了d的适用范围。},

abstract = {Recently, the security of RSA variants with moduli $$N=p^rq$$, e.g., the Takagi RSA and the prime power RSA, have been actively studied in several papers. Due to the unusual composite moduli and rather complex key generations, the analyses are more involved than the standard RSA. Furthermore, the method used in some of these works are specialized to the form of composite integers $$N=p^rq$$. 
 
In this paper, we generalize the techniques used in the current best attacks on the standard RSA to the RSA variants. We show that the lattices used to attack the standard RSA can be transformed into lattices to attack the variants where the dimensions are larger by a factor of $$r+1$$ of the original lattices. We believe the steps we took present to be more natural than previous researches, and to illustrate this point we obtained the following results:Simpler proof for small secret exponent attacks on the Takagi RSA proposed by Itoh et al. CT-RSA 2008. Our proof generalizes the work of Herrmann and May PKC 2010.Partial key exposure attacks on the Takagi RSA; generalizations of the works of Ernst et al. Eurocrypt 2005 and Takayasu and Kunihiro SAC 2014. Our attacks improve the result of Huang et al. ACNS 2014.Small secret exponent attacks on the prime power RSA; generalizations of the work of Boneh and Durfee Eurocrypt 1999. Our attacks improve the results of Sarkar DCC 2014, ePrint 2015 and Lu et al. Asiacrypt 2015.Partial key exposure attacks on the prime power RSA; generalizations of the works of Ernst et al. and Takayasu and Kunihiro. Our attacks improve the results of Sarkar and Lu et al. 
 
The construction techniques and the strategies we used are conceptually easier to understand than previous works, owing to the fact that we exploit the exact connections with those of the standard RSA.},

abstract = {Thus far, partial key exposure attacks on RSA have been intensively studied using lattice based Coppersmith’s methods. In the context, attackers are given partial information of a secret exponent and prime factors of (Multi-Prime) RSA where the partial information is exposed in various ways. Although these attack scenarios are worth studying, there are several known attacks whose constructions have similar flavor. In this paper, we try to formulate general attack scenarios to capture several existing ones and propose attacks for the scenarios. Our attacks contain all the state-of-the-art partial key exposure attacks, e.g., due to Ernst et al. (Eurocrypt’05) and Takayasu-Kunihiro (SAC’14, ICISC’14), as special cases. As a result, our attacks offer better results than previous best attacks in some special cases, e.g., Sarkar-Maitra’s partial key exposure attacks on RSA with the most significant bits of a prime factor (ICISC’08) and Hinek’s partial key exposure attacks on Multi-Prime RSA (J. Math. Cryptology ’08). We claim that our contribution is not only generalizations or improvements of the existing results. Since our attacks capture general exposure scenarios, the results can be used as a tool kit; the security of some future variants of RSA can be examined without any knowledge of Coppersmith’s methods.},

abstract = {So far, several papers have analyzed attacks on RSA when attackers know the least significant bits of a secret exponent d as well as a public modulus N and a public exponent e, the so-called partial key exposure attacks. Aono ACISP 2013, and Takayasu and Kunihiro ACISP 2014 generalized the attacks when there are multiple pairs of a public/secret exponent $$e_1,d_1,\ldots ,e_n,d_n$$ for the same public modulus N. The standard RSA is a special case of the generalization, i.e., $$n=1$$. They revealed that RSA becomes more vulnerable when there are more exponent pairs. However, their results have two obvious drawbacks. First, partial key exposure situations which they considered are restrictive. They have proposed the attacks only for small secret exponents, although attacks for large secret exponents have also been analyzed for the standard RSA. Second, they could not generalize the attacks perfectly. More concretely, their attacks for $$n=1$$ do not correspond to the currently known best attacks on the standard RSA. 
 
In this paper, we propose improved partial key exposure attacks on RSA with multiple exponent pairs. Our results completely solve the above drawbacks. Our attacks are the first results for large exponents, and our attacks for $$n=1$$ correspond to the currently known best attacks on the standard RSA. Our results for small secret exponents are superior to previous results when $$n=1$$ and 2, and when $$n \ge 3$$ and $$d_1,\ldots ,d_n>N^{3n-1/3n+1}$$.},

abstract = {In 1982, Quisquater and Couvreur proposed an RSA variant, called RSA-CRT, based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem to speed up RSA decryption. In 1990, Wiener suggested another RSA variant, called Rebalanced-RSA, which further speeds up RSA decryption by shifting decryption costs to encryption costs. However, this approach essentially maximizes the encryption time since the public exponent e is generally about the same order of magnitude as the RSA modulus. In this paper, we introduce two variants of Rebalanced-RSA in which the public exponent e is much smaller than the modulus, thus reducing the encryption costs, while still maintaining low decryption costs. For a 1024-bit RSA modulus, our first variant (Scheme A) offers encryption times that are at least 2.6 times faster than that in the original Rebalanced-RSA, while the second variant (Scheme B) offers encryption times at least 3 times faster. In both variants, the decrease in encryption costs is obtained at the expense of slightly increased decryption costs and increased key generation costs. Thus, the variants proposed here are best suited for applications which require low costs in encryption and decryption.},

Bleichenbacher and May (PKC’06) proposed an attack for small \(d_q\) when the prime factor p is significantly smaller than the other prime factor q; the attack works for \(p<N^{0.468}\). Jochemsz and May (Crypto’07) proposed an attack for small \(d_p\) and \(d_q\) where the prime factors p and q are balanced; the attack works for \(d_p,d_q<N^{0.073}\). Even after a decade has passed since their proposals, the above two attacks are still considered to be the state-of-the-art, and no improvements have been made thus far. A novel technique seems to be required for further improvements since the attacks have been studied with all the applicable techniques for Coppersmith’s methods proposed by Durfee-Nguyen (Asiacrypt’00), Jochemsz-May (Asiacrypt’06), and Herrmann-May (Asiacrypt’09, PKC’10). In this paper, we propose two improved attacks on the small CRT-exponent RSA: a small \(d_q\) attack for \(p<N^{0.5}\) (an improvement of Bleichenbacher-May’s) and a small \(d_p\) and \(d_q\) attack for \(d_p,d_q<N^{0.091}\) (an improvement of Jochemsz-May’s). We use Coppersmith’s lattice-based method to solve modular equations and obtain the improvements from a novel lattice construction by exploiting useful algebraic structures of the CRT-RSA key generation. We explicitly show proofs of our attacks and verify the validities by computer experiments. In addition to the two main attacks, we propose small \(d_q\) attacks on several variants of RSA.},

abstract = {The RSA cryptosystem invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in 1977 is today’s most important public-key cryptosystem. Its wide application has drawn much attention to its security. Let us begin by describing a simplified version of RSA encryption. The RSA modulus is the product of two large primes of the same size, usually denoted by N = pq where p, q are the two primes. The encryption exponent e, and the decryption exponent d are two integers satisfying ed = 1 mod φ(N) where φ(N) = (p − 1)(q − 1). A message M is encrypted by C = M mod N where the pair e,N is called the public key. To decrypt the ciphertext C, the legitimate receiver who owns d, called the private key or the secret key, computes M = C mod N . It is clear that the security of RSA cryptosystem relies on the difficulty of inverting the RSA encryption function on the average, i.e. extracting eth roots in the ring ZN . Subsequently, the first attack on RSA is to factor the modulus N . Given the factorization of N , an attacker can easily construct φ(N), from which the decryption exponent d = e−1 mod φ(N) can be found. Currently, the running time of the fastest method to factor an n-bit integer in general is exp((c+ (1))n log n) for some c < 2. While this general method of factoring large integers is far from posing a threat to the security of RSA, it is still unclear whether the difficulty of inverting the RSA encryption function is equivalent to that of factoring large integers. Indeed, researchers have long been exploring ways of recovering d or M without directly factoring N . This survey on RSA attacks is intended to cover those ways. The article is organized as follows. Section 2, Section 3 and Section 4 deals with the attacks enabled by the weak private exponent, the weak public exponent, the partial key exposure and the implementation details of RSA respectively. Section 5 concludes the article.},

The point of our work is based on the observation that we can split the private exponent into two much smaller unknown variables and solve a related modular equation on the two unknown variables and other auxiliary variables by making use of lattice based methods. Moreover, we extend this method to analyze the common private exponent RSA scheme, a variant of Dual RSA, and obtain a better bound than previous analyses.

abstract = {Abstract Partial key exposure attacks on RSA have been intensively studied by using lattice-based Coppersmith's methods. Ernst et al. (Eurocrypt'05) studied the problem by considering three attack scenarios; (1) the most significant bits (MSBs) of a secret exponent d known, (2) the least significant bits (LSBs) of d known, (3) both the MSBs and the LSBs of d known. The proposed attacks were valuable since they were the first results to handle full size exponents e. Takayasu and Kunihiro (SAC'14, Theoretical Computer Science'19) proposed improved attacks for (1) and (2) when d is sufficiently small, i.e., d N 0.5625 for (1) and d N 0.368 for (2), by utilizing a linearization technique. In this paper, we extend Takayasu-Kunihiro's attacks and improve Ernst et al.'s attack for (3). In particular, our attack contains Takayasu-Kunihiro's attacks for (1) and (2) as special cases when the amount of given LSBs and MSBs are zero, respectively. Furthermore, as opposed to Takayasu-Kunihiro's attacks, our improvement against Ernst et al.'s attack is not limited to small secret exponents such as d N 0.5625 . Indeed, we are able to improve Ernst et al.'s attack almost up to full size decryption exponents, i.e., even when d is close to N. Technically, the extension is not straightforward. We first modify Takayasu-Kunihiro's lattice basis matrix for (2), so that is is compatible to embed the given MSBs. The modification is crucial for embedding both the MSBs and the LSBs simultaneously to the matrix.},

In this paper, we present three applications of the technique. The first one is to show deterministic polynomial time equivalence between factoring $N$ ($N = pq$, where $p > q$ or $p, q$ are of same bit size) and knowledge of $q$-1 mod $p$. Next, we consider the problem of finding smooth integers in a short interval. The third one is to factorize $N$ given a multiple of the decryption exponent in RSA.    
In Asiacrypt 2006, Jochemsz and May presented a general strategy for finding roots of a polynomial. We apply that technique to solve the following two problems. The first one is to factorize $N$ given an approximation of a multiple of the decryption exponent in RSA. The second one is to solve the implicit factorization problem given three RSA moduli considering certain portions of LSBs as well as MSBs of one set of three secret primes are same.},

abstract = {Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), Quisquater and Couvreur proposed an RSA variant, RSA-CRT, to speedup RSA decryption. According to RSA-CRT, Wiener suggested another RSA variant, Rebalanced RSA-CRT, to further speedup RSA-CRT decryption by shifting decryption cost to encryption cost. However, such an approach will make RSA encryption very time-consuming because the public exponent e in Rebalanced RSA-CRT will be of the same order of magnitude as φ(N). In this paper we study the following problem: does there exist any secure variant of Rebalanced RSA-CRT, whose public exponent e is much shorter than φ(N)? We solve this problem by designing a variant of Rebalanced RSA-CRT with dp and dq of 198 bits. This variant has the public exponent e = 2 + 1 such that its encryption is about 3 times faster than that of the original Rebalanced RSA-CRT.},

abstract = {Boneh and Durfee (Eurocrypt 1999) proposed two polynomial time attacks on small secret exponent RSA. The first attack works when d < N0.284 whereas the second attack works when d < N0.292. Both attacks are based on lattice based Coppersmith's method to solve modular equations. Durfee and Nguyen (Asiacrypt 2000) extended the attack to a variant of RSA where prime factors are not the same sizes. However, the attack extended only the first attack of the Boneh-Durfee. Hence, an open problem remains, i.e., if the Boneh-Durfee second attack can be extended to unbalanced RSA. In this paper, we propose a desired attack that extended the Boneh-Durfee second attack. Our proposed attack fully improves the Durfee-Nguyen attack for all size of prime factors. The improvement stems from our technical lattice construction. Although Durfee and Nguyen only analyzed lattices whose basis matrices are triangular, we analyze broader classes of lattices that contain non-triangular basis matrices. The analysis can be performed by using the unravelled linearization proposed by Herrmann and May (Asiacrypt 2009) and the transformation on the Boneh-Durfee lattices proposed by Takayasu and Kunihiro (PKC 2016). As a result, we can exploit useful algebraic structure compared with the Durfee-Nguyen.},

abstract = {We present a principled technique for reducing the matrix size in some applications of Coppersmith's lattice method for finding roots of modular polynomial equations. It relies on an analysis of the actual performance of Coppersmith's attack for smaller parameter sizes, which can be thought of as "focus group" testing. When applied to the small-exponent RSA problem, it reduces lattice dimensions and consequently running times (sometimes by factors of two or more). We also argue that existing metrics (such as enabling condition bounds) are not as important as often thought for measuring the true performance of attacks based on Coppersmith's method. Finally, experiments are given to indicate that certain lattice reductive algorithms (such as Nguyen-Stehl\'e's L2) may be particularly well-suited for Coppersmith's method.},
