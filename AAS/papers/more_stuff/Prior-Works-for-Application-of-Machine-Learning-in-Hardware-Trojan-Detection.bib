abstract = {This paper presents a novel hardware Trojan detection technique in gate-level netlist based on the controllability and observability analyses. Using an unsupervised clustering analysis, the paper shows that the controllability and observability characteristics of Trojan gates present significant inter-cluster distance from those of genuine gates in a Trojan-inserted circuit, such that Trojan gates are easily distinguishable. The proposed technique does not require any golden model and can be easily integrated into the current integrated circuit design flow. Furthermore, it performs a static analysis and does not require any test pattern application for Trojan activation either partially or fully. In addition, the timing complexity of the proposed technique is an order of the number of signals in a circuit. Moreover, the proposed technique makes it possible to fully restore an inserted Trojan and to isolate its trigger and payload circuits. The technique has been applied on various types of Trojans, and all Trojans are successfully detected with 0 false positive and negative rates in less than 14 s in the worst case.},

abstract = {Recently, we face a serious risk that malicious third-party vendors can very easily insert hardware Trojans into their IC products but it is very difficult to analyze huge and complex ICs. In this paper, we propose a hardware-Trojan classification method to identify hardware-Trojan infected nets (or Trojan nets) using a support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, we extract the five hardware-Trojan features in each net in a netlist. Secondly, since we cannot effectively give the simple and fixed threshold values to them to detect hardware Trojans, we represent them to be a five-dimensional vector and learn them by using SVM. Finally, we can successfully classify a set of all the nets in an unknown netlist into Trojan ones and normal ones based on the learned SVM classifier. We have applied our SVM-based hardware-Trojan classification method to Trust-HUB benchmarks and the results demonstrate that our method can much increase the true positive rate compared to the existing state-of-the-art results in most of the cases. In some cases, our method can achieve the true positive rate of 100%, which shows that all the Trojan nets in a netlist are completely detected by our method.},

abstract = {Recently, due to the increase of outsourcing in IC design, it has been reported that malicious third-party vendors often insert hardware Trojans into their ICs. How to detect them is a strong concern in IC design process. The features of hardware-Trojan infected nets (or Trojan nets) in ICs often differ from those of normal nets. To classify all the nets in netlists designed by third-party vendors into Trojan ones and normal ones, we have to extract effective Trojan features from Trojan nets. In this paper, we first propose 51 Trojan features which describe Trojan nets from netlists. Based on the importance values obtained from the random forest classifier, we extract the best set of 11 Trojan features out of the 51 features which can effectively detect Trojan nets, maximizing the F-measures. By using the 11 Trojan features extracted, the machine-learning based hardware Trojan classifier has achieved at most 100% true positive rate as well as 100% true negative rate in several TrustHUB benchmarks and obtained the average F-measure of 74.6%, which realizes the best values among existing machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection methods.},

abstract = {Hardware design today bears similarities to software design. Often vendors buy and integrate code acquired from third-party organizations into their designs, especially in embedded/system-on-chip designs. Currently, there is no way to determine if third-party designs have built-in backdoors that can compromise security after deployment. The key observation we use to approach this problem is that hardware backdoors incorporate logic that is nearly-unused, i.e. stealthy. The wires used in stealthy backdoor circuits almost never influence the outputs of those circuits. Typically, they do so only when triggered using external inputs from an attacker. In this paper, we present FANCI, a tool that flags suspicious wires, in a design, which have the potential to be malicious. FANCI uses scalable, approximate, boolean functional analysis to detect these wires. Our examination of the TrustHub hardware backdoor benchmark suite shows that FANCI is able to flag all suspicious paths in the benchmarks that are associated with backdoors. Unlike prior work in the area, FANCI is not hindered by incomplete test suite coverage and thus is able to operate in practice without false negatives. Furthermore, FANCI reports low false positive rates: less than 1% of wires are reported as suspicious in most cases. All TrustHub designs were analyzed in a day or less. We also analyze a backdoor-free out-of-order microprocessor core to demonstrate applicability beyond benchmarks.},

abstract = {Recently, digital ICs are often designed by outside vendors to reduce design costs in semiconductor industry, which may introduce severe risks that malicious attackers implement Hardware Trojans (HTs) on them. Since IC design phase generates only a single design result, an RT-level or gate-level netlist for example, we cannot assume an HT-free netlist or a Golden netlist and then it is too difficult to identify whether a generated netlist is HT-free or HT-inserted. In this paper, we propose a score-based classification method for identifying HT-free or HT-inserted gate-level netlists without using a Golden netlist. Our proposed method does not directly detect HTs themselves in a gate-level netlist but a net included in HTs, which is called Trojan net, instead. Firstly, we observe Trojan nets from several HT-inserted benchmarks and extract several their features. Secondly, we give scores to extracted Trojan net features and sum up them for each net in benchmarks. Then we can find out a score threshold to classify HT-free and HT-inserted netlists. Based on these scores, we can successfully classify HT-free and HT-inserted netlists in all the Trust-HUB gate-level benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully identify all the HT-inserted gate-level benchmarks to be “HT-inserted” and all the HT-free gate-level benchmarks to be “HT-free” in approximately three hours for each benchmark.},

abstract = {The areas of hardware security and trust have experienced major growth over the past several years. However, research in Trojan detection and prevention lacks standard benchmarks and measurements, resulting in inconsistent research outcomes, and ambiguity in analyzing strengths and weaknesses in the techniques developed by different research teams and their advancements to the state-of-the-art. We have developed innovative methodologies that, for the first time, more effectively address the problem. We have developed a vulnerability analysis flow. The flow determines hard-to-detect areas in a circuit that would most probably be used for Trojan implementation to ensure a Trojan goes undetected during production test and extensive functional test analysis. Furthermore, we introduce the Trojan detectability metric to quantify Trojan activation and effect. This metric offers a fair comparison for analyzing weaknesses and strengths of Trojan detection techniques. Using these methodologies, we have developed a large number of trust benchmarks that are available for use by the public, as well as researchers and practitioners in the field.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans inserted during design or fabrication time by untrustworthy design house or foundry possesses important security concerns. These Trojans lead to un-desired change in functionality of the design and provide easy access to sensitive information. Trojans attacks or malicious activities are triggered based on very rare conditions, which can evade test-time Trojan detection but can arise during long hours of field operation. In this paper we propose a run-time Trojan detection architecture for a custom many-core based on Machine Learning technique. We exploit Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised machine learning algorithms. The Data-set is generated based on many-core router behavior under normal and Trojan triggered settings. The paper targets different communication attacks triggered by Hardware Trojans, namely core address spoofing, traffic diversion, route looping attack. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has detection accuracy in the range of 94% to 97%.We implemented a framework for many-core architecture with SVM kernel while triggering Trojans based on two different conditions. To demonstrate the performance of proposed security framework, we implement a bio-medical seizure detection application as a case study. The algorithm is mapped on 64 processing cores and it takes 2.1μS to execute whereas with the proposed security framework it requires 4.8μS execution time. The Distributed Attack Detection Framework is implemented with each attack detection module having 2% area overhead.},

abstract = {Malicious tampering of the internal circuits of ICs can lead to detrimental results. Insertion of Trojan circuits may change system behavior, cause chip failure or send information to a third party. This paper presents an information-theoretic approach for Trojan detection. It estimates the statistical correlation between the signals in a design, and explores how this estimation can be used in a clustering algorithm to detect the Trojan logic. Compared with the other algorithms, our tool does not require extensive logic analysis. We neither need the circuit to be brought to the triggering state, nor the effect of the Trojan payload to be propagated and observed at the output. Instead we leverage already available simulation data in this information-theoretic approach. We conducted experiments on the TrustHub benchmarks to validate the practical efficacy of this approach. The results show that our tool can detect Trojan logic with up to 100% coverage with low false positive rates.},
