abstract = {Ransomware is a growing threat that encrypts auser's files and holds the decryption key until a ransom ispaid by the victim. This type of malware is responsible fortens of millions of dollars in extortion annually. Worse still, developing new variants is trivial, facilitating the evasion of manyantivirus and intrusion detection systems. In this work, we presentCryptoDrop, an early-warning detection system that alerts a userduring suspicious file activity. Using a set of behavior indicators, CryptoDrop can halt a process that appears to be tampering witha large amount of the user's data. Furthermore, by combininga set of indicators common to ransomware, the system can beparameterized for rapid detection with low false positives. Ourexperimental analysis of CryptoDrop stops ransomware fromexecuting with a median loss of only 10 files (out of nearly5,100 available files). Our results show that careful analysis ofransomware behavior can produce an effective detection systemthat significantly mitigates the amount of victim data loss.},

Indeed, the remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cyber-criminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes suggest that a fair number of users are actually paying the ransoms. Unfortunately, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient nowadays, because often we do not have the luxury of being able to isolate a sample to analyze, and when this happens it is already too late for several users! We believe that a forward-looking solution is to equip modern operating systems with practical self-healing capabilities against this serious threat. Towards such a vision, we propose ShieldFS, an add-on driver that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware attacks. For each running process, ShieldFS dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-on-write mechanism, according to the outcome of its detection component. Internally, ShieldFS monitors the low-level filesystem activity to update a set of adaptive models that profile the system activity over time. Whenever one or more processes violate these models, their operations are deemed malicious and the side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back. We designed ShieldFS after an analysis of billions of low-level, I/O filesystem requests generated by thousands of benign applications, which we collected from clean machines in use by real users for about one month. This is the first measurement on the filesystem activity of a large set of benign applications in real working conditions. We evaluated ShieldFS in real-world working conditions on real, personal machines, against samples from state of the art ransomware families. ShieldFS was able to detect the malicious activity at runtime and transparently recover all the original files. Although the models can be tuned to fit various filesystem usage profiles, our results show that our initial tuning yields high accuracy even on unseen samples and variants.},

abstract = {Ransomware is one of the most increasing malwares used by cyber-criminals in recent days. This type of malware uses cryptographic technology that encrypts a user's important files, folders makes the computer systems unusable, holds the decryption key and asks for the ransom from the victims for recovery. The recent ransomware families are very sophisticated and difficult to analyze & detect using static features only. On the other hand, latest crypto-ransomwares having sandboxing and IDS evading capabilities. So obviously, static or dynamic analysis of the ransomware alone cannot provide better solution. In this paper, we will present a Machine Learning based approach which will use integrated method, a combination of static and dynamic analysis to detect ransomware. The experimental test samples were taken from almost all ransomware families including the most recent “WannaCry”. The results also suggest that combined analysis can detect ransomware with better accuracy compared to individual analysis approach. Since ransomware samples show some “run-time” and “static code” features, it also helps for the early detection of new and similar ransomware variants.},

Ransomware encrypts the victim’s important files and then requires money to decrypt them. Ransomware has become among the most preferred measures for cybercriminals to earn money. Moreover, the technology for producing ransomware continues to evolve; as a result, it has becomes more difficult to defend. In this study, we analyze major ransomware including WannaCry and propose a method to protect valuable files from existing ransomware. To this end, the moving target defense method is applied by randomly changing the file extensions that ransomware attempts to encrypt. We show that our proposed method can successfully protect files from ransomware. Finally, we present the proposed method which can be reasonably used without performance degradation.},

Such a behavior corresponds to the classical scenario of a malicious ransomware. We show that the Kullback-Liebler divergence can be used to detect with high effectiveness whether a process transforms structured input files (such as JPEG files) into unstructured encrypted files, or not. We focus mainly on JPEG files since irreplaceable pictures represent in many cases the most valuable data on personal computers or smartphones.},

The only way to unlock the infected device or to have the keys for decrypting the files is to pay a ransom to the attacker. Commercial solutions for removing ransomware and restoring the infected devices and files are ineffective, since this malware uses a very robust form of asymmetric cryptography and erases shadow copies and recovery points of the operating system. Literature does not count many solutions for effectively detecting and blocking ransomware and, at the best knowledge of the authors, formal methods were never applied to identify ransomware. In this paper we propose a methodology based on formal methods that is able to detect the ransomware and to identify in the malware's code the instructions that implement the characteristic instructions of the ransomware. The results of the experimentation are strongly encouraging and suggest that the proposed methodology could be the right way to follow for developing commercial solutions that could successful intercept the ransomware and blocking the infections it provokes.},

We present ShieldFS, a drop-in driver that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware attacks, even when detection fails ShieldFS dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-onwrite mechanism whenever its detection component reveals suspicious activity. For this, ShieldFS monitors the filesystem’s internals to update a set of adaptive models that profile the system activity over time. This detection is based on a study of the filesystem activity of over 2,245 applications, and takes into account the entropy of write operations, frequency of read, write, and folder-listing operations, fraction of files renamed, and the file-type usage statistics. Additionally, ShieldFS monitors the memory pages of each “potentially malicious” process, searching for traces of the typical block cipher key schedules. We show how ShieldFS can shadow the write operations. Whenever one or more processes violate our detection component, their operations are deemed malicious and the side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back.

The recent resurgence of high-profile ransomware attacks, particularly in critical sectors such as the healthcare industry, has highlighted the pressing need for effective defenses. While users are always advised to have a reliable backup strategy, the growing number of paying victims in recent years suggests that new defense mechanisms that minimize the destructive effects of ransomware attacks are needed. However, there are undeniable similarities between ransomware and other types of malware attacks. Hence, the two main questions that are often asked are: What are the challenges in defending against ransomware that can be solved using existing malware detection techniques? And, what are the new intellectual challenges that require developing new tools and techniques? In this article, we summarize some of the challenges in developing anti-ransomware solutions by considering the similarities and differences between ransomware and other types of malware attacks.},

We also provide a holistic view on how ransomware attacks have evolved during this period by analyzing 1,359 samples that belong to 15 different ransomware families. Our results show that, despite a continuous improvement in the encryption, deletion, and communication techniques in the main ransomware families, the number of families with sophisticated destructive capabilities remains quite small. In fact, our analysis reveals that in a large number of samples, the malware simply locks the victim's computer desktop or attempts to encrypt or delete the victim's files using only superficial techniques.i?źOur analysis also suggests that stopping advanced ransomware attacks is not as complex as it has been previously reported. For example, we show that by monitoring abnormal file system activity, it is possible to design a practical defense system that could stop a large number of ransomware attacks, even those using sophisticated encryption capabilities. A close examination on the file system activities of multiple ransomware samples suggests that by looking at I/O requests and protecting Master File Table MFT in the NTFS file system, it is possible to detect and prevent a significant number of zero-day ransomware attacks.},

Although the concept of ransomware is not new (i.e., such attacks date back at least as far as the 1980s), this type of malware has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In fact, over the last few years, a number of high-profile ransomware attacks were reported. Very recently, WannaCry ransomware infected thousands of vulnerable machines around the world, and substantially disrupted critical services such as British healthcare system. Given the size and variety of threats we are facing today, having solutions to effectively detect and analyze unknown ransomware attacks seems necessary. In this thesis, we argue that it is possible to extend existing defense mechanisms, and protect user data from a large number of ransomware attacks with zero data loss. To support this claim, in the first part of the thesis, we perform an evolutionary-based analysis to understand the destructive behavior of ransomware attacks. We show that by monitoring the interaction of malicious processes with the operating system, it is possible to design practical defense mechanisms that could stop even very successful cryptographic ransomware attacks. In the second part, we propose a novel dynamic analysis system, called Unveil, that is designed to analyze ransomware attacks, and model their interactions. In the third and the last part, we propose an end-point framework, called Redemption, to protect user data from ransomware attacks. We present an operating system-independent design, and also provide implementation details which show that such lightweight solutions could be integrated into existing operating systems while achieving zero data loss in a large number of successful ransomware attacks.},

abstract = {The word ransomware and the associated phenomenon appeared something like 3 years ago, around the year 2005. It shed light on a specific class of malwares which demand a payment in exchange for a stolen functionality. Most widespread ransomwares make an intensive use of file encryption as an extortion mean. Basically, they encrypt various files on victim’s hard drives before asking for a ransom to get the files decrypted. Security related media and some antivirus vendors quickly brandished this “new” type of virii as a major threat for computer world. This article tries to investigate the foundation of these threats beyond the phenomenon. In order to get a better understanding of ransomwares, the study relies on a comparative analysis of various ransomware virii. Based on reverse-engineering while not focused on analysis methodology, a technical review is done at different levels: quality of code, malwares’ functionalities and analysis of cryptographic primitives if any. Our analysis leads us to many interesting approaches and conclusions concerning this phenomenon, and in particular the strength and weakness of used extortion means. We also take advantage of our technical review to stand back and to analyse both the business model associated to these ransomwares and the communication that has been made around them.},

Our paper examines the ransomware from another point of view by describing an interesting property of it, namely, the overinfection management, or the way of handling multiple infections on the same target. We show that the overinfection in ransomware can have four levels: Level 0 to ensure that the ransomware is not executed twice at the same time on the same machine, Level 1 to avoid re-encrypting its encrypted files, Level 2 to coordinate between its infections on the same machine and Level 3 to manage the infection between many target machines in the same computer park.},

On closer inspection, they differ from other malware infections: Given appropriate preparation, they do not need to be caught on first sight, but can be undone later. However, current ransomware protection follows the beaten path of anti-malware copying their fallacies. We show how the move to personal cloud storage allows for a paradigm shift in ransomware protection: exceptional attack isolation, perfect elimination of false positive alerts, and simplified recovery. In this paper, we analyze the necessary operations for ransomware, extend existing ransomware taxonomy, and verify them against real-world malware samples. We analyze the costs and benefits of moving ransomware detection to versioned personal cloud storage. Our content, meta data, and behavior analysis paired with a ‘guilt by association’ capability greatly improve the false positive rate, but the guided undo make this rate all but inconsequential. Even though the user now carries a new burden, it comes with clear responsibilities and benefits, while being freed from questionable duties, resulting in a win-win situation for user experience and detection quality.},

abstract = {Recent worldwide cybersecurity attacks caused by Cryptographic Ransomware infected systems across countries and organizations with millions of dollars lost in paying extortion amounts. This form of malicious software takes user files hostage by encrypting them and demands a large ransom payment for providing the decryption key. Signature-based methods employed by Antivirus Software are insufficient to evade Ransomware attacks due to code obfuscation techniques and creation of new polymorphic variants everyday. Generic Malware Attack vectors are also not robust enough for detection as they do not completely track the specific behavioral patterns shown by Cryptographic Ransomware families. This work based on analysis of an extensive dataset of Ran-somware families presents RansomWall, a layered defense system for protection against Cryptographic Ransomware. It follows a Hybrid approach of combined Static and Dynamic analysis to generate a novel compact set of features that characterizes the Ransomware behavior. Presence of a Strong Trap Layer helps in early detection. It uses Machine Learning for unearthing zero-day intrusions. When initial layers of RansomWall tag a process for suspicious Ransomware behavior, files modified by the process are backed up for preserving user data until it is classified as Ransomware or Benign. We implemented RansomWall for Microsoft Windows operating system (the most attacked OS by Cryptographic Ransomware) and evaluated it against 574 samples from 12 Cryptographic Ransomware families in real-world user environments. The testing of RansomWall with various Machine Learning algorithms evaluated to 98.25% detection rate and near-zero false positives with Gradient Tree Boosting Algorithm. It also successfully detected 30 zero-day intrusion samples (having less than 10% detection rate with 60 Security Engines linked to VirusTotal).},

abstract = {The paper surveys state-of-the-art studies on ransomware analysis, detection, and prediction.The work describes the enabling technologies and factors that contribute to successful ransomware attacks.The paper proposes a general taxonomy for the different ransomware types from different perspectives.The study presents open issues and future research directions on ransomware analysis, detection and prediction. The proposed taxonomy classifies ransomware from three perspectives: severity based, platform based, and target based. Ransomware is a malware category that exploits security mechanisms such as cryptography in order to hijack user files and related resources and demands money in exchange for the locked data. Therefore, ransomware has become a lucrative business that has gained increasing popularity among attackers. Unlike traditional malware, even after removal, ransomware's effect is irreversible and difficult to mitigate without the help of its creator. In addition to the downtime costs and the money that individuals and business entities could pay as a ransom, those victims could incur other damage such as loss of data, reputation, and life. To date, several studies have been conducted to address this unique, challenging threat and have tried to provide detection and prevention solutions. However, there is a lack of survey articles that explore the research endeavors in ransomware and highlight the challenges and issues faced by existing solutions. This survey fills the gap and provides a holistic state-of-the-art review of the research on ransomware and its detection and prevention techniques. The survey puts forward a novel ransomware taxonomy, from several perspectives. It then elaborates on the factors that lead to a successful ransomware attacks before discussing in detail the research into counteracting ransomware, including analysis, prevention, detection and prediction solutions. The survey concludes with a brief discussion on the open issues and potential research directions in the near future.},

abstract = {Ransomwares have become a growing threat in recent years, and this situation continues to worsen. It rose awareness on a particular class of malwares which extort a ransom in exchange for a captive asset. Most widespread ransomwares make an intensive use of data encryption. Basically, they encrypt various files on victim's hard drives, removable drives and mapped network shares before asking for a ransom to get the files decrypted. In this paper, at first we propose a comprehensive ransomware taxonomy. Then, based on this taxonomy and according to a principal feature which we discovered in high survivable ransomwares (HSR) in the key exchange protocol step, we present a novel approach for detecting high survivable ransomwares and preventing them from encrypting victim's data. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our framework can detect variants of recent dangerous ransomwares.},

abstract = {Ransomware has recently (re)emerged as a popular malware that targets a wide range of victims - from individual users to corporate ones for monetary gain. Our key observation on the existing ransomware detection mechanisms is that they fail to provide an early warning in real-time which results in irreversible encryption of a significant number of files while the post-encryption techniques (e.g., key extraction, file restoration) suffer from several limitations. Also, the existing detection mechanisms result in high false positives being unable to determine the original intent of file changes, i.e., they fail to distinguish whether a significant change in a file is due to a ransomware encryption or due to a file operation by the user herself (e.g., benign encryption or compression). To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a ransomware detection mechanism, RWGuard, which is able to detect crypto-ransomware in real-time on a user’s machine by (1) deploying decoy techniques, (2) carefully monitoring both the running processes and the file system for malicious activities, and (3) omitting benign file changes from being flagged through the learning of users’ encryption behavior. We evaluate our system against samples from 14 most prevalent ransomware families to date. Our experiments show that RWGuard is effective in real-time detection of ransomware with zero false negative and negligible false positive (\(\sim \)0.1%) rates while incurring an overhead of only \(\sim \)1.9%.},

abstract = {In ransomware attacks, the actual target is the human, as opposed to the classic attacks that abuse the infected devices e.g., botnet renting, information stealing. Mobile devices are by no means immune to ransomware attacks. However, there is little research work on this matter and only traditional protections are available. Even state-of-the-art mobile malware detection approaches are ineffective against ransomware apps because of the subtle attack scheme. As a consequence, the ample attack surface formed by the billion mobile devices is left unprotected. 
 
First, in this work we summarize the results of our analysis of the existing mobile ransomware families, describing their common characteristics. Second, we present HelDroid, a fast, efficient and fully automated approach that recognizes known and unknown scareware and ransomware samples from goodware. Our approach is based on detecting the "building blocks" that are typically needed to implement a mobile ransomware application. Specifically, HelDroid detects, in a generic way, if an app is attempting to lock or encrypt the device without the user's consent, and if ransom requests are displayed on the screen. Our technique works without requiring that a sample of a certain family is available beforehand. 
 
We implemented HelDroid and tested it on real-world Android ransomware samples. On a large dataset comprising hundreds of thousands of APKs including goodware, malware, scareware, and ransomware, HelDroid exhibited nearly zero false positives and the capability of recognizing unknown ransomware samples.},

abstract = {Traditionally, cryptography and its applications are defensive in nature, and provide privacy, authentication, and security to users. In this paper we present the idea of Cryptovirology which employs a twist on cryptography, showing that it can also be used offensively. By being offensive we mean that it can be used to mount extortion based attacks that cause loss of access to information, loss of confidentiality, and information leakage, tasks which cryptography typically prevents. In this paper we analyze potential threats and attacks that rogue use of cryptography can cause when combined with rogue software (viruses, Trojan horses), and demonstrate them experimentally by presenting an implementation of a cryptovirus that we have tested (we took careful precautions in the process to insure that the virus remained contained). Public-key cryptography is essential to the attacks that we demonstrate (which we call "cryptovirological attacks"). We also suggest countermeasures and mechanisms to cope with and prevent such attacks. These attacks have implications on how the use of cryptographic tools should be managed and audited in general purpose computing environments, and imply that access to cryptographic tools should be well controlled. The experimental virus demonstrates how cryptographic packages can be condensed into a small space, which may have independent applications (e.g., cryptographic module design in small mobile devices).},

abstract = {Encryption ransomware is a malicious software that stealthily encrypts user files and demands a ransom to provide access to these files. Several prior studies have developed systems to detect ransomware by monitoring the activities that typically occur during a ransomware attack. Unfortunately, by the time the ransomware is detected, some files already undergo encryption and the user is still required to pay a ransom to access those files. Furthermore, ransomware variants can obtain kernel privilege, which allows them to terminate software-based defense systems, such as anti-virus. While periodic backups have been explored as a means to mitigate ransomware, such backups incur storage overheads and are still vulnerable as ransomware can obtain kernel privilege to stop or destroy backups. Ideally, we would like to defend against ransomware without relying on software-based solutions and without incurring the storage overheads of backups. To that end, this paper proposes FlashGuard, a ransomware tolerant Solid State Drive (SSD) which has a firmware-level recovery system that allows quick and effective recovery from encryption ransomware without relying on explicit backups. FlashGuard leverages the observation that the existing SSD already performs out-of-place writes in order to mitigate the long erase latency of flash memories. Therefore, when a page is updated or deleted, the older copy of that page is anyway present in the SSD. FlashGuard slightly modifies the garbage collection mechanism of the SSD to retain the copies of the data encrypted by ransomware and ensure effective data recovery. Our experiments with 1,447 manually labeled ransomware samples show that FlashGuard can efficiently restore files encrypted by ransomware. In addition, we demonstrate that FlashGuard has a negligible impact on the performance and lifetime of the SSD.},

abstract = {Similar to criminals in the physical world, cyber-criminals use a variety of illegal and immoral means to achieve monetary gains. Recently, malware known as ransomware started to leverage strong cryptographic primitives to hold victims' computer files "hostage" until a ransom is paid. Victims, with no way to defend themselves, are often advised to simply pay. Existing defenses against ransomware rely on ad-hoc mitigations that target the incorrect use of cryptography rather than generic live protection. To fill this gap in the defender's arsenal, we describe the approach, prototype implementation, and evaluation of a novel, automated, and most importantly proactive defense mechanism against ransomware. Our prototype, called PayBreak, effectively combats ransomware, and keeps victims' files safe. PayBreak is based on the insight that secure file encryption relies on hybrid encryption where symmetric session keys are used on the victim computer. PayBreak observes the use of these keys, holds them in escrow, and thus, can decrypt files that would otherwise only be recoverable by paying the ransom. Our prototype leverages low overhead dynamic hooking techniques and asymmetric encryption to realize the key escrow mechanism which allows victims to restore the files encrypted by ransomware. We evaluated PayBreak for its effectiveness against twenty hugely successful families of real-world ransomware, and demonstrate that our system can restore all files that are encrypted by samples from twelve of these families, including the infamous CryptoLocker, and more recent threats such as Locky and SamSam. Finally, PayBreak performs its protection task at negligible performance overhead for common office workloads and is thus ideally suited as a proactive online protection system.},

abstract = {Due to recent indiscriminate attacks of ransomware, damage cases including encryption of users’ important files are constantly increasing. The existing vaccine systems are vulnerable to attacks of new pattern ransomware because they can only detect the ransomware of existing patterns. More effective technique is required to prevent modified ransomware. In this paper, an effective method is proposed to prevent the attacks of modified ransomware on Android platform. The proposed technique specifies and intensively monitors processes and specific file directories using statistical methods based on Processor usage, Memory usage, and I/O rates so that the process with abnormal behaviors can be detected. If the process running a suspicious ransomware is detected, the proposed system will stop the process and take steps to confirm the deletion of programs associated with the process from users. The information of suspected and exceptional processes confirmed by users is stored in a database. The proposed technique can detect ransomware even if you do not save its patterns. Its speed of detection is very fast because it can be implemented in Android source code instead of mobile application. In addition, it can effectively determine modified patterns of ransomware and provide protection with minimum damage.},

To make the system more resilient against tampering from sophisticated attackers, AccessMiner is implemented as a custom hypervisor that sits below the operating system. In this paper we discuss the implementation details and the technical solutions we adopted to optimize the performances and reduce the impact of the system.Our experiments show that in a stable environment AccessMiner can provide a high level of protection (around 90% detection rate with zero false positives) with an acceptable overhead - similar to the one that can be experienced in a state of the art virtual machine environment.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the number and sophistication of malware-related attacks and infections. Many detection techniques have been proposed to mitigate the malware threat. A running theme among existing detection techniques is the similar promises of high detection rates, in spite of the wildly different models (or specification classes) of malicious activity used. In addition, the lack of a common testing methodology and the limited datasets used in the experiments make difficult to compare these models in order to determine which ones yield the best detection accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to measure how the choice of behavioral models influences the quality of a malware detector. We tackle this problem by executing a large number of testing experiments, in which we explored the parameter space of over 200 different models, corresponding to more than 220 million of signatures. Our results suggest that commonly held beliefs about simple models are incorrect in how they relate changes in complexity to changes in detection accuracy. This implies that accuracy is non-linear across the model space, and that analytical reasoning is insufficient for finding an optimal model, and has to be supplemented by testing and empirical measurements.},

abstract = {Although the concept of ransomware is not new (i.e., such attacks date back at least as far as the 1980s), this type of malware has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In fact, in the last few years, a number of high-profile ransomware attacks were reported, such as the large-scale attack against Sony that prompted the company to delay the release of the film "The Interview." Ransomware typically operates by locking the desktop of the victim to render the system inaccessible to the user, or by encrypting, overwriting, or deleting the user's files. However, while many generic malware detection systems have been proposed, none of these systems have attempted to specifically address the ransomware detection problem. 
 
In this paper, we present a novel dynamic analysis system called UNVEIL that is specifically designed to detect ransomware. The key insight of the analysis is that in order to mount a successful attack, ransomware must tamper with a user's files or desktop. UNVEIL automatically generates an artificial user environment, and detects when ransomware interacts with user data. In parallel, the approach tracks changes to the system's desktop that indicate ransomware-like behavior. Our evaluation shows that UNVEIL significantly improves the state of the art, and is able to identify previously unknown evasive ransomware that was not detected by the antimalware industry.},

abstract = {Abstract Ransomware has become a pandemic nowadays. Although some proposals exist to fight against this increasing type of extortion, most of them are prevention like and rely on the assumption that early detection is not so effective once the victim is infected. This paper presents a novel approach intended not just to early detect ransomware but to completely thwart its action. For that, a set of honeyfiles is deployed around the target environment in order to catch the ransomware. Instead of being normal archives, honeyfiles are FIFO like, so that the ransomware is blocked once it starts reading the file. In addition to frustrate its action, our honeyfile solution is able to automatically launch countermeasures to solve the infection. Moreover, as it does not require previous training or knowledge, the approach allows fighting against unknown, zero-day ransomware related attacks. As a proof of concept, we have developed the approach for Linux platforms. The tool, named R-Locker , shows excellent performance both from the perspective of its accuracy as well as in terms of complexity and resource consumption. In addition, it has no special needs or privileges and does not affect the normal operation of the overall environment.},

abstract = {Recent statistics show that in 2015 more than 140 millions new malware samples have been found. Among these, a large portion is due to ransomware, the class of malware whose specific goal is to render the victim's system unusable, in particular by encrypting important files, and then ask the user to pay a ransom to revert the damage. Several ransomware include sophisticated packing techniques, and are hence difficult to statically analyse. We present EldeRan, a machine learning approach for dynamically analysing and classifying ransomware. EldeRan monitors a set of actions performed by applications in their first phases of installation checking for characteristics signs of ransomware. Our tests over a dataset of 582 ransomware belonging to 11 families, and with 942 goodware applications, show that EldeRan achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.995. Furthermore, EldeRan works without requiring that an entire ransomware family is available beforehand. These results suggest that dynamic analysis can support ransomware detection, since ransomware samples exhibit a set of characteristic features at run-time that are common across families, and that helps the early detection of new variants. We also outline some limitations of dynamic analysis for ransomware and propose possible solutions.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files of infected hosts and demands payment, often in a crypto-currency like Bitcoin. In this paper, we create a measurement framework that we use to perform a large-scale, two-year, end-to-end measurement of ransomware payments, victims, and operators. By combining an array of data sources, including ransomware binaries, seed ransom payments, victim telemetry from infections, and a large database of bitcoin addresses annotated with their owners, we sketch the outlines of this burgeoning ecosystem and associated third-party infrastructure. In particular, we are able to trace the financial transactions, from the acquisition of bitcoins by victims, through the payment of ransoms, to the cash out of bitcoins by the ransomware operators. We find that many ransomware operators cashed out using BTC-e, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange. In total we are able to track over $16 million USD in likely ransom payments made by 19,750 potential victims during a two-year period. While our study focuses on ransomware, our methods are potentially applicable to other cybercriminal operations that have similarly adopted Bitcoin as their payment channel.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a form of extortion-based attack that locks the victim's digital resources and requests money to release them. Although the concept of ransomware is not new (i.e., such attacks date back at least as far as the 1980s), this type of malware has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In fact, over the last few years, a number of high-pro le ransomware attacks were reported. Very recently, WannaCry ransomware infected thousands of vulnerable machines around the world, and substantially disrupted critical services such as British healthcare system. Given the size and variety of threats we are facing today, having solutions to e ectively detect and analyze unknown ransomware attacks seems necessary. In this thesis, we argue that it is possible to develop novel defense mechanisms, and protect user data from a large number of ransomware attacks with zero data loss. We show that such an approach is both feasible and e ective. To support this claim, we investigate how a successful ransomware attack interacts with the operating system resources. In the rst part of this thesis, we perform an evolutionary-based analysis to understand the destructive behavior of these attacks. We show that by monitoring lesystem activity, it is possible to design practical defense systems that could stop a large number of ransomware attacks, even those using sophisticated encryption capabilities. In the second part, we propose a novel dynamic analysis system, called Unveil, that is designed to analyze ransomware attacks, and model their interactions with the lesystem. In the third and the last part, we propose an end-point framework, called Redemption, to protect user data from ransomware attacks. We demonstrate that our proposed solution can be retro tted into existing operating systems, and achieve zero data loss against current ransomware families without introducing alarm fatigue.},

abstract = {Models based on system calls are a popular and common approach to characterize the run-time behavior of programs. For example, system calls are used by intrusion detection systems to detect software exploits. As another example, policies based on system calls are used to sandbox applications or to enforce access control. Given that malware represents a significant security threat for today's computing infrastructure, it is not surprising that system calls were also proposed to distinguish between benign processes and malicious code.
 Most proposed malware detectors that use system calls follows program-centric analysis approach. That is, they build models based on specific behaviors of individual applications. Unfortunately, it is not clear how well these models generalize, especially when exposed to a diverse set of previously-unseen, real-world applications that operate on realistic inputs. This is particularly problematic as most previous work has used only a small set of programs to measure their technique's false positive rate. Moreover, these programs were run for a short time, often by the authors themselves.
 In this paper, we study the diversity of system calls by performing a large-scale collection (compared to previous efforts) of system calls on hosts that run applications for regular users on actual inputs. Our analysis of the data demonstrates that simple malware detectors, such as those based on system call sequences, face significant challenges in such environments. To address the limitations of program-centric approaches, we propose an alternative detection model that characterizes the general interactions between benign programs and the operating system (OS). More precisely, our system-centric approach models the way in which benign programs access OS resources (such as files and registry entries). Our experiments demonstrate that this approach captures well the behavior of benign programs and raises very few (even zero) false positives while being able to detect a significant fraction of today's malware.},
