abstract = {In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, andwill likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020,we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.},

abstract = {Recently, cybercriminals have infiltrated different sectors of the human venture to launch ransomware attacks against information technology infrastructure. They demand ransom from individuals and industries, thereby inflicting significant loss of data. The use of intelligent algorithms for ransomware attack detection began to gain popularity in recent times and proved feasible. However, no comprehensive dedicated literature review on the applications of intelligent machine learning algorithms to detect ransomware attacks on information technology infrastructure. Unlike the previous reviews on ransomware attacks, this paper aims to conduct a comprehensive survey on the detection of ransomware attacks using intelligent machine learning algorithms. The study analysed literature from different perspectives focusing on intelligent algorithms detection of ransomware. The survey shows that there is a growing interest in recent times (2016—date) on the application of intelligent algorithms for ransomware detection. Deep learning algorithms are gaining tremendous attention because of their ability to handle large scale datasets, prominence in the research community, and ability to solve problems better than the conventional intelligent algorithms. To date, the potentials of big data analytics are yet to be fully exploited for the smart detection of ransomware attacks. Future research opportunities from the perspective of deep learning and big data analytics to solve the challenges identified from the survey are outlined to give the research community a new direction in dealing with ransomware attacks.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is characterized by its irreversible effect even after the detection and removal. As such, the early detection is crucial to protect user data and files of being held to ransom. Several solutions have proposed utilizing the data extracted during the initial phases of the attacks before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of enough data at the early phases of the attack along with high dimensional features space renders the model prone to overfitting which decreases its detection accuracy. To this end, this paper proposed a novel redundancy coefficient gradual up-weighting approach that was incorporated to the calculation of redundancy term of mutual information to improve the feature selection process and enhance the accuracy of the detection model. Several machine learning classifiers were used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed techniques. The experimental results show that the accuracy of proposed techniques achieved higher detection accuracy. Those results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques for the early detection tasks.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts user files, deletes the original data, and asks for a ransom to recover the hijacked documents. It is a cyber threat that targets both companies and residential users, and has spread in recent years because of its lucrative results. Several articles have presented classifications of ransomware families and their typical behaviour. These insights have stimulated the creation of detection techniques for antivirus and firewall software. However, because the ransomware scene evolves quickly and aggressively, these studies quickly become outdated. In this study, we surveyed the detection techniques that the research community has developed in recent years. We compared the different approaches and classified the algorithms based on the input data they obtain from ransomware actions, and the decision procedures they use to reach a classification decision between benign or malign applications. This is a detailed survey that focuses on detection algorithms, compared to most previous studies that offer a survey of ransomware families or isolated proposals of detection algorithms. We also compared the results of these proposals.},

abstract = {In spite of being just a few years old, ransomware is quickly becoming a serious threat to our digital infrastructures, data and services. Majority of ransomware families are requesting for a ransom payment to restore a custodian access or decrypt data which were encrypted by the ransomware earlier. Although the ransomware attack strategy seems to be simple, security specialists ranked ransomware as a sophisticated attack vector with many variations and families. Wide range of features which are available in different families and versions of ransomware further complicates their detection and analysis. Though the existing body of research provides significant discussions about ransomware details and capabilities, the all research body is fragmented. Therefore, a ransomware feature taxonomy would advance cyber defenders’ understanding of associated risks of ransomware. In this paper we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first scientific taxonomy of ransomware features, aligned with Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) model. CKC is a well-established model in industry that describes stages of cyber intrusion attempts. To ease the challenge of applying our taxonomy in real world, we also provide the corresponding ransomware defence taxonomy aligned with Courses of Action matrix (an intelligence-driven defence model). We believe that this research study is of high value for the cyber security research community, as it provides the researchers with a means of assessing the vulnerabilities and attack vectors towards the intended victims.},

abstract = {Abstract The irreversible effect is what characterizes crypto-ransomware and distinguishes it from traditional malware. That is, even after neutralizing the attack, the targeted files remain encrypted and cannot be accessed without the decryption key. Thus, it is imperative to detect such a threat early, i.e. in the initial phases before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of sufficient information in initial phases of the attack is the main challenge to early detection, leading to low detection accuracy and a high rate of false alarms. This is due to the way that the existing solutions have been designed based on, which assumes the availability of complete information about the behavior of such attacks at detection time. Nevertheless, this does not hold for early detection that takes place while the attack is underway, and data are not fully available. To address such limitations, this paper proposes two novel techniques; incremental bagging (iBagging) and enhanced semi-random subspace selection (ESRS), and incorporates them into an ensemble-based detection model. The proposed iBagging was firstly used to build incremental subsets in a way that reflects the progression of crypto-ransomware behavior during its different attack phases. ESRS was then used to build optimal, noise-free and diverse features subspaces, by which, a pool of classifiers was trained. Finally, a grid search was employed to select the best combination of base classifiers. Majority voting was utilized for the final decision. The experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques and model was conducted and compared with the existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed techniques and model overcame the data limitation in the early phases of the attacks and achieved higher detection accuracy than existing solutions.},

abstract = {With the advancement of digitization in every domain, the dependency of individuals on these digitized softwares has also increased. Although these softwares can perform storage, transfer, and security of digital media easily, the threat of hardware/software failure, data tapping and breaching data has always been there. Most of these threats have been introduced by the development of malicious softwares that can provide unauthorized access of machine’s data. This malicious software was termed as malware. The development of any antimalware software to prevent the machine from malware triggers the attacker to generate new malicious operations to infect the machine. Ransomware is, however, a novel and one of the dangerous malware invented recently that restricts the user from accessing their system by locking the operating system files using strong encryption algorithms in the system unless and until a ransom is paid. Seeing the emergence of this ransomware threat and also the increasing usage of digital media, many techniques have been developed to detect the presence of different types of ransomware in different environments. Since the importance of developing techniques to prevent our machines from such attacks is increasing substantially, further research in the respective domain require thorough analysis of all the techniques that have been developed in this regard. This paper introduces the concept of ransomware and how it has been evolved. Along with various methods of handling the ransomware, thorough analysis of techniques that have been developed until now for the prevention and detection of different ransomwares is also performed. The analysis shows that there has been a big improvement in coding techniques utilized by ransomware which will eventually turn out a good detection system that considerably reduces the quantity of victim information loss.},

abstract = {Ransomware is among the most dangerous malware prevailing in today’s world. Once infected, the malware either encrypts the data or lock the system screen, and prevents the owner from accessing his data and system until some ransom money is paid, resulting in multi-million dollars of cyber-extortion annually. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the owner would regain access to the seized data after payment is made. Ransomware attacks keep troubling the cybersecurity community; researchers are working towards developing efficient techniques for the detection and prevention of ransomware attacks. In this paper, we are attempting to review the existing solutions based on the methodology adopted and validate them using specific performance metrics.},

abstract = {Abstract “All of your files have been encrypted!”, “Your device has been locked!”, and so on are the sentences that these days are often seen in the cyber world. Motivated by recent promotions of technology, ransomware attack has soared saliently in terms of volume, versatility, and intricacy. This attack has initiated a lucrative trade by holding users’ resources, whether data or non-data, hostage and demanding to pay ransom for release them. Furthermore, it has begun to camouflage other malware in many cyber-attacks. As a result, designing approaches to vanquish such threat should be taken into account. Understanding attack cycle and having an exhaustive taxonomy of ransomware, specially associated technologies, can assist to develop security measures at the various parts of attack flow. This paper has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of ransomware and digital extortion threats. A discrete and dedicated attack chain called I2CE3 has been proposed for ransomware regardless of its subcategories. The proposed chain offers six consecutive phases that ransomware species go through to triumph in attack. Afterwards, the present work has elaborated the role of all technologies involved in each phase. Finally, based on the proffered chain, performed studies and security solutions have been considered and segregated.},

abstract = {The cryptography employed against user files makes the effect of crypto-ransomware attacks irreversible even after detection and removal. Thus, detecting such attacks early, i.e. during pre-encryption phase before the encryption takes place is necessary. Existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions use a fixed time-based thresholding approach to determine the pre-encryption phase boundaries. However, the fixed time thresholding approach implies that all samples start the encryption at the same time. Such assumption does not necessarily hold for all samples as the time for the main sabotage to start varies among different crypto-ransomware families due to the obfuscation techniques employed by the malware to change its attack strategies and evade detection, which generates different attack behaviors. Additionally, the lack of sufficient data at the early phases of the attack adversely affects the ability of feature extraction techniques in early detection models to perceive the characteristics of the attacks, which, consequently, decreases the detection accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a Dynamic Pre-encryption Boundary Delineation and Feature Extraction (DPBD-FE) scheme that determines the boundary of the pre-encryption phase, from which the features are extracted and selected more accurately. Unlike the fixed thresholding employed by the extant works, DPBD-FE tracks the pre-encryption phase for each instance individually based on the first occurrence of any cryptography-related APIs. Then, an annotated Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (aTF-IDF) technique was utilized to extract the features from runtime data generated during the pre-encryption phase of crypto-ransomware attacks. The aTF-IDF overcomes the challenge of insufficient attack patterns during the early phases of the attack lifecycle. The experimental evaluation shows that DPBD-FE was able to determine the pre-encryption boundaries and extract the features related to this phase more accurately compared to related works.},
