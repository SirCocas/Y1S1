abstract = {In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.},

abstract = {
 The COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed a huge surge in the number of ransomware attacks. Different institutions such as healthcare, financial, and government have been targeted. There can be numerous reasons for such a sudden rise in attacks, but it appears working remotely in home-based environments (which is less secure compared to traditional institutional networks) could be one of the reasons. Cybercriminals are constantly exploring different approaches like social engineering attacks, such as phishing attacks, to spread ransomware. Hence, in this paper, we explored recent advances in ransomware prevention and detection and highlighted future research challenges and directions. We also carried out an analysis of a few popular ransomware samples and developed our own experimental ransomware, AESthetic, that was able to evade detection against eight popular antivirus programs.

abstract = {Ransomware remains an alarming threat in the 21st century. It has evolved from being a simple scare tactic into a complex malware capable of evasion. Formerly, end-users were targeted via mass infection campaigns. Nevertheless, in recent years, the attackers have focused on targeted attacks, since the latter are profitable and can induce severe damage. A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used. Finally, we propose a roadmap for researchers to fill the gaps found in the literature in ransomware’s battle.},

abstract = {Recently, cybercriminals have infiltrated different sectors of the human venture to launch ransomware attacks against information technology infrastructure. They demand ransom from individuals and industries, thereby inflicting significant loss of data. The use of intelligent algorithms for ransomware attack detection began to gain popularity in recent times and proved feasible. However, no comprehensive dedicated literature review on the applications of intelligent machine learning algorithms to detect ransomware attacks on information technology infrastructure. Unlike the previous reviews on ransomware attacks, this paper aims to conduct a comprehensive survey on the detection of ransomware attacks using intelligent machine learning algorithms. The study analysed literature from different perspectives focusing on intelligent algorithms detection of ransomware. The survey shows that there is a growing interest in recent times (2016—date) on the application of intelligent algorithms for ransomware detection. Deep learning algorithms are gaining tremendous attention because of their ability to handle large scale datasets, prominence in the research community, and ability to solve problems better than the conventional intelligent algorithms. To date, the potentials of big data analytics are yet to be fully exploited for the smart detection of ransomware attacks. Future research opportunities from the perspective of deep learning and big data analytics to solve the challenges identified from the survey are outlined to give the research community a new direction in dealing with ransomware attacks.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is characterized by its irreversible effect even after the detection and removal. As such, the early detection is crucial to protect user data and files of being held to ransom. Several solutions have proposed utilizing the data extracted during the initial phases of the attacks before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of enough data at the early phases of the attack along with high dimensional features space renders the model prone to overfitting which decreases its detection accuracy. To this end, this paper proposed a novel redundancy coefficient gradual up-weighting approach that was incorporated to the calculation of redundancy term of mutual information to improve the feature selection process and enhance the accuracy of the detection model. Several machine learning classifiers were used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed techniques. The experimental results show that the accuracy of proposed techniques achieved higher detection accuracy. Those results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques for the early detection tasks.},

abstract = {Modern ransomware often generate and manage cryptographic keys on the victim’s machine, giving defenders an opportunity to capture exposed keys and recover encrypted data without paying the ransom. However, recent work has raised the possibility of future enclave-enhanced malware that could avoid such mitigations using emerging support for hardware-enforced secure enclaves in commodity CPUs. Nonetheless, the practicality of such enclave-enhanced malware and its potential impact on all phases of the ransomware lifecyle remain unclear. Given the demonstrated capacity of ransomware authors to innovate in order to better extort their victims (e.g. through the adoption of untraceable virtual currencies and anonymity networks), it is important to better understand the risks involved and identify potential mitigations. As a basis for comprehensive security and performance analysis of enclave-enhanced ransomware, we present RansomClave, a family of ransomware that securely manage their cryptographic keys using an enclave. We use RansomClave to explore the implications of enclave-enhanced ransomware for the key generation, encryption and key release phases of the ransomware lifecycle, and to identify potential limitations and mitigations. We propose two plausible victim models and analyse, from an attacker’s perspective, how RansomClave can protect cryptographic keys from each type of victim. We find that some existing mitigations are likely to be effective during the key generation and encryption phases, but that RansomClave enables new trustless key release schemes that could potentially improve attacker’s profitability and, by extension, make enclaves an attractive target for future attackers.},

It is a cyber threat that targets both companies and residential users, and has spread in recent years because of its lucrative results. Several articles have presented classifications of ransomware families and their typical behaviour. These insights have stimulated the creation of detection techniques for antivirus and firewall software. However, because the ransomware scene evolves quickly and aggressively, these studies quickly become outdated. In this study, we surveyed the detection techniques that the research community has developed in recent years. We compared the different approaches and classified the algorithms based on the input data they obtain from ransomware actions, and the decision procedures they use to reach a classification decision between benign or malign applications. This is a detailed survey that focuses on detection algorithms, compared to most previous studies that offer a survey of ransomware families or isolated proposals of detection algorithms. We also compared the results of these proposals.},

This study aims to mitigate by experiment with building a prevention system through computer network management. The mitigation process is carried out through static, dynamic, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) analysis to prevent the impact of attacks through programmatic network management. SDN consists of two main components in its implementation, the Ryu controller and Open Virtual Switch (OVS). Result testing mitigation system on infected networks by crippling TCP internet protocol access can reduce virus spread by 17.13% and suppress Sodinokibi traffic logs by up to 73.97%. Based on the percentage data, SDN-based mitigation in this study is per the objectives to make it possible to mitigate Ransomware attacks on computer network traffic.},

Several articles have presented detection techniques for this type of malware; these techniques are applied before the ransomware encrypts files or during its action in an infected host. The evaluation of these proposals has always been accomplished using sets of ransomware samples that are prepared locally for the research article, without making the data available. Different studies use different sets of samples and different evaluation metrics, resulting in insufficient comparability. In this paper, we describe a public data repository containing the file access operations of more than 70 ransomware samples during the encryption of a large network shared directory. These data have already been used successfully in the evaluation of a network-based ransomware detection algorithm. Now, we are making these data available to the community and describing their details, how they were captured, and how they can be used in the evaluation and comparison of the results of most ransomware detection techniques.},
