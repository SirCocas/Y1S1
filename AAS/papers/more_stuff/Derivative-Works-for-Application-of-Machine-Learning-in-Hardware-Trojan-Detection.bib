abstract = {In the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) securing the protection of the supply chain has become an ever-growing concern. One such cyber threat is a Hardware Trojan (HT), a malicious modification to an integrated circuit (IC). HTs are often identified in the hardware manufacturing process, but should be removed earlier, when the design is being specified. Machine learning-based HT detection in gate-level netlists is an efficient approach to identify HTs at the early stage. However, feature-based modeling has limitations in discovering an appropriate set of HT features. We thus propose NHTD-GL in this paper, a novel node-wise HT detection method based on graph learning (GL). Given the formal analysis of HT features obtained from domain knowledge, NHTD-GL bridges the gap between graph representation learning and feature-based HT detection. The experimental results demonstrate that NHTD-GL achieves 0.998 detection accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art node-wise HT detection methods. NHTD-GL extracts HT features without heuristic feature engineering.},

abstract = {System-on-chip (SoC) developers increasingly rely on pre-verified hardware intellectual property (IP) blocks acquired from untrusted third-party vendors. These IPs might contain hidden malicious functionalities or hardware Trojans to compromise the security of the fabricated SoCs. Recently, supervised machine learning (ML) techniques have shown promising capability in identifying nets of potential Trojans in third party IPs (3PIPs). However, they bring several major challenges. First, they do not guide us to an optimal choice of features that reliably covers diverse classes of Trojans. Second, they require multiple Trojan-free/trusted designs to insert known Trojans and generate a trained model. Even if a set of trusted designs are available for training, the suspect IP could be inherently very different from the set of trusted designs, which may negatively impact the verification outcome. Third, these techniques only identify a set of suspect Trojan nets that require manual intervention to understand the potential threat. In this paper, we present VIPR, a systematic machine learning (ML) based trust verification solution for 3PIPs that eliminates the need for trusted designs for training. We present a comprehensive framework, associated algorithms, and a tool flow for obtaining an optimal set of features, training a targeted machine learning model, detecting suspect nets, and identifying Trojan circuitry from the suspect nets. We evaluate the framework on several Trust-Hub Trojan benchmarks and provide a comparative analysis of detection performance across different trained models, selection of features, and post-processing techniques. The proposed post-processing algorithms reduce false positives by up to 92.85%.},

abstract = {The remarkable success of machine learning (ML) in a variety of research domains has inspired academic and industrial communities to explore its potential to address hardware Trojan (HT) attacks. While numerous works have been published over the past decade, few survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, have systematically reviewed the achievements and analyzed the remaining challenges in this area. To fill this gap, this article surveys ML-based approaches against HT attacks available in the literature. In particular, we first provide a classification of all possible HT attacks and then review recent developments from four perspectives, i.e., HT detection, design-for-security (DFS), bus security, and secure architecture. Based on the review, we further discuss the lessons learned in and challenges arising from previous studies. Despite current work focusing more on chip-layer HT problems, it is notable that novel HT threats are constantly emerging and have evolved beyond chips and to the component, device, and even behavior layers, therein compromising the security and trustworthiness of the overall hardware ecosystem. Therefore, we divide the HT threats into four layers and propose a hardware Trojan defense (HTD) reference model from the perspective of the overall hardware ecosystem, therein categorizing the security threats and requirements in each layer to provide a guideline for future research in this direction.},

abstract = {Recent trends in integrated circuits industry include decentralization of the production flow by involving different integration teams, third-party IP vendors and other untrusted entities. As a result, this is opening up a door to new types of attacks that may lead to devastating consequences, such as denial of service or data leakage. Therefore, the problem of ensuring hardware security has gained much attention in the last years, especially early in the design cycle, when an attacker may insert malicious circuitry at register transfer (RT) or gate level. Due to the increased complexity of modern devices, the research community is spending a lot of effort in developing more sophisticated detection methodologies and smarter attacks. However, the main problem is that they are validated on the existing benchmarks that do not reflect the real complexity. Trying to fill this gap, this paper proposes a set of RT-Level Hardware Trojan benchmarks injected in a RISC-based pipelined microprocessor core. To prove the viability, the impacts on area, power and frequency are presented and discussed. For any proposed Hardware Trojan, the functional description, the implementation details and the effects once activated are provided.},

abstract = {Abstract Every year, the rate at which technology is applied on areas of our everyday life is increasing at a steady pace. This rapid development drives the technology companies to design and fabricate their integrated circuits (ICs) in non-trustworthy outsourcing foundries to reduce the cost, thus, leaving space for a synchronous form of virus, known as Hardware Trojan (HT), to be developed. HTs leak encrypted information, degrade device performance or lead to total destruction. To reduce the risks associated with these viruses, various approaches have been developed aiming to prevent and detect them, based on conventional or machine learning methods. Ideally, any undesired modification made to an IC should be detectable by pre-silicon verification/simulation and post-silicon testing. The infected circuit can be inserted in different stages of the manufacturing process, rendering the detection of HTs a complicated procedure. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to countermeasures against HTs embedded into ICs. The literature is grouped in four main categories; (a) conventional HT detection approaches, (b) machine learning for HT countermeasures, (c) design for security and (d) runtime monitor.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) are acknowledged as a significant emerging security concern in the IC industry resulting from the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain. Recently, taking advantage of the exponential growth in computing power, machine learning (ML) approaches such as neural networks (NNs) are being considered for HT detection. However, the circuit structure and components of an IC design are different from the data types in the ML models. To efficiently extract HT features from complex IC designs and utilize common ML-based detection approaches is challenging. In this paper, a novel HT feature extraction strategy based on gate-level circuit netlists is proposed to tackle the challenges. The HT features are extracted from the circuit topology rather than statistical analysis in previous research. A commonly utilized support vector machine (SVM)-based HT detection model is employed for data training and testing using the extracted features on HT benchmarks from both open-sourced library and HT generation platform to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed HT feature extraction strategy. The detection results show high recall in nearly all tested benchmarks, achieving at most 97.7% recall on sequential Trojans and 84.8% on combinational ones.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs), maliciously inserted in an integrated circuit during untrusted design or fabrication process pose critical threat to the system security. With the ever increasing capabilities of an adversary to subvert the system during run-time, it is imperative to detect the manifested Trojans in order to reinforce the trust in hardware. In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, with their intrinsic capability to execute feature engineering at high learning rates, are emerging as promising candidates to be utilized by system defenders. In this paper, we explore Trojan detection mechanisms that are based on ML, and thereby investigate the prowess of the ML algorithms in bolstering system security. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency of each proposed Trojan detection strategy based on the underlying ML algorithm. Finally, we underline some problems with existing Trojan detection approaches and discuss future research in the interest of improved performance of the employed ML algorithms, thus aiding in enhancing the intended hardware security.},
