Capturing RAM from a Live Windows Machine
1) run FTK Imager portable from a USB disk with write blocker
To enable write protection:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies] "WriteProtect"=dword:00000001
To disable  write protection:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies] "WriteProtect"=dword:00000000
2) The USB disk shall have two partitions: Tools and Evidences 
3) Run action “Capture Memory” > memory.dump (include pagefile.sys)
4) pagefile.sys is the "paging file" that contains Windows' virtual memory.  
5) Select AD1 if you want to analyse the file with Access Data tools. 
6) Select destination folder “Evidences\Memory” and press OK
7) Use a hashing tool to hash the results and document all your actions
8) Digitally sign the report.
9) memory.dump file will be analysed latter with “Volatility” tool. 

Capturing Protected Files (Registry Settings) from a Live Windows Machine
1) Run action “Obtain Protected Files”
2) Notice “warning message”
3) Select destination folder “Evidences\Registry”, select “full capture” and press OK
4) Check results and use a hashing tool to hash the results and document all your actions
7) Digitally sign the report.
6) Use the “RegistryReport”, “ForensicUserInfo” and “WRR” tools to analyse the captured files.

Create a Forensic Live Image 
1) Use a write blocker
2) Run action “Create Image” and select source type (Physical, Logic, Image File, Contents  Folder and Fernico Device)
3) Select source Drive and Add a destination image format type
4) RAW dd (bit by bit copy), Smart (used for older linux processes), e01 (encase) and aff (advanced forensics format, open-source similar to e01)
5) Fill evidence information (adopt evidence tags from your organization)
6) Select folder destination (Evidences\Image), image file name, fragmentation and compression levels and remember to use 4096 MB fragmentation (or less) if destination drive is FAT32.  
8) Verify the result hashes and the Report.txt
9) Digitally sign the report.

Create Custom Content Image 
1) Locate Custom Content Pane and Drag it to de top
2) View -> Reset Docked Windows if needed
3) Select a folder and Add to the Custom Content Sources
4) Edit the content to use filters (? -replace a char, * -replace all chars, | separate folders)
5) Create a AD1 image and fill evidence information (set filter by file owner)
6) Check image summary

Examining Evidence
- Never work on the original (must reimage or create a copy first)
  - Create image from source (Physical Drive, Logical Drive, Image File, Content Folder, Fernico Device)
- Actions in FTK Imager may start either from the menu or from the icons in the top bar
- If the image is AD encrypted, it must be decrypted first.
- Add Evidence > Image File (initial E01 file) to the "Evidence Tree" (up left window)
  - Check partitions and Unpartitioned Space (EFI system partition, main partition, recovery partition)
  - Notice the Properties panes (bottom windows) 
  - Notice the Remove Evidence Item action
- Add Evidence > Custom Image (AD1 file)
- Image Mounting (Physical and/or Logical only; if we want to use Windows Explorer we must Mount Logical)
  - Choose read block only or writable (a cache will be used to register the changes, so the original will not be changed)
  - At the end, do not forget to unmount the image

Triaging Evidence
- After we add evidence, if we select a folder, the property panes start to show information
- Check File List, Properties and View panes after you select a Folder
  - View (Automatic, Text e Hexadecimal); it is possible to export the file (check EXIF properties, if present)
  - Properties pane gives details about dates and times, verification hashes and NTFS information (MFT record number, Owner Security Identifier (SID), etc).
- Inside the root is %MFT (Master File Table). It is a database of every file inside the NTFS
  - Use “find” to look for files; find record holder (magic number: FILE0)
  - go to offset (current position) to find (creation time of the file 80d (8 bytes) , file change time, file read time)  
  - This is not the file itself, is just its record on the MFT. 
- Find deleted files on $Recycle.Bin (user’s SID)
- Find ADS (Alternate Data Streams) (see ADS explanation)
