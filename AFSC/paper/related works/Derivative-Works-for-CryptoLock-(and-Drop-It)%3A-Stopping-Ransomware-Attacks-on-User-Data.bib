abstract = {In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, andwill likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020,we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts user files, deletes the original data, and asks for a ransom to recover the hijacked documents. It is a cyber threat that targets both companies and residential users, and has spread in recent years because of its lucrative results. Several articles have presented classifications of ransomware families and their typical behaviour. These insights have stimulated the creation of detection techniques for antivirus and firewall software. However, because the ransomware scene evolves quickly and aggressively, these studies quickly become outdated. In this study, we surveyed the detection techniques that the research community has developed in recent years. We compared the different approaches and classified the algorithms based on the input data they obtain from ransomware actions, and the decision procedures they use to reach a classification decision between benign or malign applications. This is a detailed survey that focuses on detection algorithms, compared to most previous studies that offer a survey of ransomware families or isolated proposals of detection algorithms. We also compared the results of these proposals.},

Nos contre-mesures sont concues pour etre temps reel et deployees sur une machine, c'est-a-dire ''End-Hosts''. En 2013 les logiciels de rancon font de nouveau parler d'eux, pour finalement devenir une des menaces les plus serieuses a partir de 2015. Un etat de l'art detaille des contre-mesures existantes est fourni. On peut ainsi situer les contributions de cette these par rapport a la litterature. Nous presentons egalement une plateforme d'analyse automatique de logiciels malveillants composee de machines nues. L'objectif est de ne pas alterer le comportement des echantillons analyses. Une premiere contre-mesure basee sur l'utilisation d'une librairie cryptographique par les logiciels de rancon est proposee. Celle-ci peut etre facilement contournee. Nous proposons donc une seconde contre-mesure generique et agnostique. Cette fois, des indicateurs de compromission sont utilises pour analyser le comportement des processus sur le systeme de fichiers. Nous detaillons comment de maniere empirique nous avons parametre cette contre-mesure pour la rendre~: utilisable et efficace. Un des challenges de cette these etant de faire concilier performance, taux de detection et un faible taux de faux positifs. Enfin, les resultats d'une experience utilisateur sont presentes. Cette experience analyse le comportement des utilisateurs face a une menace. En derniere partie, nous proposons des ameliorations a nos contributions mais aussi des pistes a explorer.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to a victim’s computing resources and demands a ransom in order to restore access. This is a continually growing and costly threat across the globe, therefore efforts have been made both in academia and industry to develop techniques that can help to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of Windows-based anti-ransomware tools and techniques, using a clear, simple and consistent terminology in terms of Data Sources, Processing and Actions. We extensively analysed relevant literature so that, to the best of our knowledge, we had at the time covered all approaches taken to detect and recover from ransomware attacks. We grouped these techniques according to their main features as a way to understand the landscape. We then selected 15 existing anti-ransomware tools both to examine how they fit into this landscape and to compare them by aggregating their accuracy and overhead – two of the most important selection criteria of these tools – as reported by the tools’ respective authors. We were able to determine popular solutions and unexplored gaps that could lead to promising areas of anti-ransomware development. From there, we propose two novel detection techniques, namely serial byte correlation and edit distance. This paper serves as a much needed roadmap of knowledge and ideas to systematise the current landscape of anti-ransomware tools.},

abstract = {In the last decade, crypto-ransomware evolved from a family of malicious software with scarce repercussion in the research community, to a sophisticated and highly effective intrusion method positioned in the spotlight of the main organizations for cyberdefense. Its modus operandi is characterized by fetching the assets to be blocked, their encryption, and triggering an extortion process that leads the victim to pay for the key that allows their recovery. This paper reviews the evolution of crypto-ransomware focusing on the implication of the different advances in communication technologies that empowered its popularization. In addition, a novel defensive approach based on the Self-Organizing Network paradigm and the emergent communication technologies (e.g. Software-Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, Cloud Computing, etc.) is proposed. They enhance the orchestration of smart defensive deployments that adapt to the status of the monitoring environment and facilitate the adoption of previously defined risk management policies. In this way it is possible to efficiently coordinate the efforts of sensors and actuators distributed throughout the protected environment without supervision by human operators, resulting in greater protection with increased viability},

abstract = {The paper surveys state-of-the-art studies on ransomware analysis, detection, and prediction.The work describes the enabling technologies and factors that contribute to successful ransomware attacks.The paper proposes a general taxonomy for the different ransomware types from different perspectives.The study presents open issues and future research directions on ransomware analysis, detection and prediction. The proposed taxonomy classifies ransomware from three perspectives: severity based, platform based, and target based. Ransomware is a malware category that exploits security mechanisms such as cryptography in order to hijack user files and related resources and demands money in exchange for the locked data. Therefore, ransomware has become a lucrative business that has gained increasing popularity among attackers. Unlike traditional malware, even after removal, ransomware's effect is irreversible and difficult to mitigate without the help of its creator. In addition to the downtime costs and the money that individuals and business entities could pay as a ransom, those victims could incur other damage such as loss of data, reputation, and life. To date, several studies have been conducted to address this unique, challenging threat and have tried to provide detection and prevention solutions. However, there is a lack of survey articles that explore the research endeavors in ransomware and highlight the challenges and issues faced by existing solutions. This survey fills the gap and provides a holistic state-of-the-art review of the research on ransomware and its detection and prevention techniques. The survey puts forward a novel ransomware taxonomy, from several perspectives. It then elaborates on the factors that lead to a successful ransomware attacks before discussing in detail the research into counteracting ransomware, including analysis, prevention, detection and prediction solutions. The survey concludes with a brief discussion on the open issues and potential research directions in the near future.},

abstract = {Abstract “All of your files have been encrypted!”, “Your device has been locked!”, and so on are the sentences that these days are often seen in the cyber world. Motivated by recent promotions of technology, ransomware attack has soared saliently in terms of volume, versatility, and intricacy. This attack has initiated a lucrative trade by holding users’ resources, whether data or non-data, hostage and demanding to pay ransom for release them. Furthermore, it has begun to camouflage other malware in many cyber-attacks. As a result, designing approaches to vanquish such threat should be taken into account. Understanding attack cycle and having an exhaustive taxonomy of ransomware, specially associated technologies, can assist to develop security measures at the various parts of attack flow. This paper has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of ransomware and digital extortion threats. A discrete and dedicated attack chain called I2CE3 has been proposed for ransomware regardless of its subcategories. The proposed chain offers six consecutive phases that ransomware species go through to triumph in attack. Afterwards, the present work has elaborated the role of all technologies involved in each phase. Finally, based on the proffered chain, performed studies and security solutions have been considered and segregated.},

abstract = {In spite of being just a few years old, ransomware is quickly becoming a serious threat to our digital infrastructures, data and services. Majority of ransomware families are requesting for a ransom payment to restore a custodian access or decrypt data which were encrypted by the ransomware earlier. Although the ransomware attack strategy seems to be simple, security specialists ranked ransomware as a sophisticated attack vector with many variations and families. Wide range of features which are available in different families and versions of ransomware further complicates their detection and analysis. Though the existing body of research provides significant discussions about ransomware details and capabilities, the all research body is fragmented. Therefore, a ransomware feature taxonomy would advance cyber defenders’ understanding of associated risks of ransomware. In this paper we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first scientific taxonomy of ransomware features, aligned with Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) model. CKC is a well-established model in industry that describes stages of cyber intrusion attempts. To ease the challenge of applying our taxonomy in real world, we also provide the corresponding ransomware defence taxonomy aligned with Courses of Action matrix (an intelligence-driven defence model). We believe that this research study is of high value for the cyber security research community, as it provides the researchers with a means of assessing the vulnerabilities and attack vectors towards the intended victims.},

Several articles have presented detection techniques for this type of malware; these techniques are applied before the ransomware encrypts files or during its action in an infected host. The evaluation of these proposals has always been accomplished using sets of ransomware samples that are prepared locally for the research article, without making the data available. Different studies use different sets of samples and different evaluation metrics, resulting in insufficient comparability. In this paper, we describe a public data repository containing the file access operations of more than 70 ransomware samples during the encryption of a large network shared directory. These data have already been used successfully in the evaluation of a network-based ransomware detection algorithm. Now, we are making these data available to the community and describing their details, how they were captured, and how they can be used in the evaluation and comparison of the results of most ransomware detection techniques.},
