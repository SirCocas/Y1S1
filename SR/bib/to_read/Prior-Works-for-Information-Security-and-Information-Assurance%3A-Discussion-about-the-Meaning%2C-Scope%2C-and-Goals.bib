abstract = {During the last twenty years, the impact of security concerns on the development and exploitation of information systems never ceased to grow. Security risk management methods are methodological tools, helping organisations to take rational decisions, regarding the security of their IS. Feedbacks on the use of such approaches show that they considerably reduce losses originating from security problems. Today, these methods are generally built around a well structured process. However, the product coming from the different risk management steps is still largely informal, and often not analytical enough. This lack of formality hinders the automation of the management of risk-related information. Another drawback of current methods is that they are generally designed for being used a posteriori, that is, to assess the way existing systems handle risks, and are with difficulty usable a priori, during information system development. Finally, with method using its own terminology, it is difficult to combine several methods, in the aim of taking advantage of each of them. For tackling the preceding problems, this thesis proposes a model-based approach for risk management, applicable from the early phases of information system development. This approach relies on a study of the domain's own concepts. This scientific approach is composed of three successive steps. The first step aims at defining a reference conceptual model for security risk management. The research method followed proposes to base the model on an extensive study of the literature. The different risk management and/or security standards, a set of methods representative of the current state of the practice, and the scientific works related to the domain, are analysed. The result is a semantic alignment table of the security risk management concepts, highlighting the key concepts taking place in such an approach. Based on this set of concepts, the security risk management domain model is built. This model is challenged by domain experts in standardisation, risk management practitioners and scientists. The second step of this research work enriches the domain model with the different metrics used in a risk management method. The proposed approach combines two methods to define this set of metrics. The first one is the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) method applied on the domain model. This method allows to focus on reaching the best return on security investment. The second one enriches the metrics identified with the first approach, through a study of the literature based on standards and methods addressed during the first step. An experimentation on a real case of these metrics is performed, in the frame of supporting a SME towards the ISO/IEC 27001 certification. Finally, in a third step, a set of conceptual modelling languages dedicated to information security is noticed in the literature. These languages are mainly coming from the requirements engineering domain. They allow to tackle security during the early phases of information system development. The conceptual support proposed by each of them is evaluated, and thus the gap to bridge for being able to completely model the different steps of risk management too. This work ends in an extension proposal of the Secure Tropos language, and a process to follow for using this extension in the frame of risk management, illustrated by an example.},

abstract = {Business Processes are considered a crucial issue by many enterprises because they are the key to maintain competitiveness. Moreover, business processes are important for software developers, since they can capture from them the necessary requirements for software design and creation. Besides, business process modeling is the center for conducting and improving how the business is operated. Security is important for business performance, but traditionally, it is considered after the business processes definition. Empirical studies show that, at the business process level, customers, end users, and business analysts are able to express their security needs. In this work, we will present a proposal aimed at integrating security requirements through business process modeling. We will summarize our Business Process Modeling Notation extension for modeling secure business process through Business Process Diagrams, and we will apply this approach to a typical health-care business process.},

abstract = {It is recognised that security has to be addressed through the whole system development process. However current practices address security only in late stages, i.e., development or maintenance. Due to the success of UML use cases, misuse cases have been accepted by industry as a means to tackle security. However misuse cases, firstly, lack a precise application process, secondly, are too general which results in under-definition or misinterpretation of their concepts. In this paper we examine misuse cases in the light of a reference model for information system security risk management (ISSRM). Using the well-known meeting scheduler example we show how misuse cases can be used to follow a security risk management process. Next we check the misuse case ontology according to the concepts found in current risk management standards. The paper suggests improvements for the conceptual appropriateness of misuse cases for the security risk domain.},

abstract = {Business process modelling is one of the major aspects in the modern system development. Recently business process model and notation (BPMN) has become a standard technique to support this activity. Although BPMN is a good approach to understand business processes, there is a limited work to understand how it could deal with business security and security risk management. This is a problem, since both business processes and security concerns should be understood in parallel to support a development of the secure systems. In this paper we analyse BPMN with respect to the domain model of the IS security risk management (ISSRM). We apply a structured approach to understand key aspects of BPMN and how modeller could express secure assets, risks and risk treatment using BPMN. We align the main BPMN constructs with the key concepts of the ISSRM domain model. We show applicability of our approach on a running example related to the Internet store. Our proposal would allow system analysts to understand how to develop security requirements to secure important assets defined through business processes. In addition we open a possibility for the business and security model interoperability and the model transformation between several modelling approaches (if these both are aligned to the ISSRM domain model).},

abstract = {Today, security concerns are at the heart of information systems, both at technological and organizational levels. With over 200 practitioner-oriented risk management methods and several academic security modelling frameworks available, a major challenge is to select the most suitable approach. Choice is made even more difficult by the absence of a real understanding of the security risk management domain and its ontology of related concepts. This chapter contributes to the emergence of such an ontology. It proposes and applies a rigorous approach to build an ontology, or domain model, of information system security risk management. The proposed domain model can then be used to compare, select or otherwise improve security risk management methods.},

abstract = {Security is a major target for today's information systems (IS) designers. Security modelling languages exist to reason on security in the early phases of IS development, when the most crucial design decisions are made. Reasoning on security involves analysing risk, and effectively communicating risk-related information. However, we think that current languages can be improved in this respect. In this paper, we discuss this issue for Secure Tropos, the language supporting the eponymous agent-based IS development. We analyse it and suggest improvements in the light of an existing reference model for IS security risk management. This allows for checking Secure Tropos concepts and terminology against those of current risk management standards, thereby improving the conceptual appropriateness of the language. The paper follows a running example, called eSAP, located in the healthcare domain.},

abstract = {Service-oriented Architectures deliver a flexible infrastructure to allow independently developed software components to communicate in a seamless manner. In the scope of organisational workflows, SOA provides a suitable foundation to execute business processes as an orchestration of multiple independent services. Along with the increased connectivity, the corresponding security risks rise exponentially. However, security requirements are usually defined on a technical level, rather than on an organisational level that would provide a comprehensive view on the participants, the assets and their relationships regarding security.In this paper, we propose an approach to describe security requirements at the business process layer and their translation to concrete security configuration for service-based systems. We introduce security elements for business process modelling which allow to evaluate the trustworthiness of participants based on a rating of enterprise assets and to express security intentions such as confidentiality or integrity on an abstract level. Our aim is to facilitate the generation of security configurations based on the modelled requirements. For this purpose, we foster a model-driven approach: Information at the modelling layer is gathered and translated to a domain-independent security model. Concrete protocols and security mechanisms are resolved based on a security pattern system that is introduced in the course of this paper.},

The authors find that although the scientific impact of JITSR is comparatively low, it is recognized in different disciplines. The findings also show that research published in JITSR is, to some extent, interdisciplinary; papers published in JITSR refer to a number of different disciplines.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to business process modelling deal with security only after the business process has been defined, namely without considering security needs as input for the definition. This may require very costly corrections if new security issues are discovered. Moreover, security concerns are mainly considered at the system level without providing the rationale for their existence, that is, without taking into account the social or organizational perspective, which is essential for business processes related to considerably large organizations. In this paper, we introduce a framework for engineering secure business processes. We propose a security requirements engineering approach to model and analyze participants’ objectives and interactions, and then derive from them a set of security requirements that are used to annotate business processes. We capture security requirements through the notion of social commitment, that is a promise with contractual validity between participants. We illustrate the framework by means of an Air Traffic Management scenario.},
