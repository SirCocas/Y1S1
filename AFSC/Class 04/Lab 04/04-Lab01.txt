Exercise 1 - Endianness

=======================================================================================
    The following instructions are for the Linux command line
    but this exercise can also be performed on Windows

=======================================================================================

1) Consider the following data structure:
   typedef struct {
      char name[32];           // 32 bytes
      char postalcode[16];     // 16 bytes
      uint32_t partner_num;    // 4 bytes
      float quota;             // 4 bytes
      char empty[8];           // 8 bytes to lineup the structure to multiples of 16 bytes
    };                         // Total = 64 bytes
    
    
    a. download the file "file.dat" (available in Moodle)
    
    b. do the following command to see the binary content of the file:
        xxd file.dat
        Tip: for windows try https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/
    
    c. can you tell which character encoding is in use for the strings? 
        Tip: take a look at the name field of several records and the number of bytes for each character.
    
    d. what are the hexadecimal values of partner_num and quota for the last record?
    
    e. If the system has a big-endian architecture, what are the decimal values of partner_num and quota for the last record? 

        Tip 1: use Bless, an hexadecimal editor you can install in linux: sudo apt-get install bless
        Tip 2: or you can also use one the onlines tools http://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html or https://www.binaryconvert.com
    
    f. And if the system has a little-endian architecture?
