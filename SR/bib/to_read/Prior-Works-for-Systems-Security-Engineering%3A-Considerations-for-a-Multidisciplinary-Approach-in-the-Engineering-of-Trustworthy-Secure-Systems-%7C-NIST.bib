abstract = {This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters, structural failures, and human errors. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages information security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/business needs. The publication also describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented security capability). Addressing both security functionality and security assurance ensures that information technology products and the information systems built from those products using sound systems and security engineering principles are sufficiently trustworthy.},

abstract = {The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation's measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL's responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL's research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

abstract = {This document provides guidelines developed in conjunction with the Department of Defense, including the National Security Agency, for identifying an information system as a national security system. The basis for these guidelines is the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA, Title III, Public Law 107-347, December 17, 2002), which provides government-wide requirements for information security, superseding the Government Information Security Reform Act and the Computer Security Act. In addition to defining the term national security system FISMA amended the NIST Act, at 15 U.SC. 278g-3(b)(3), to require NIST to provide guidelines for identifying an information system as a national security system. As stated in the House Committee report, "This guidance is not to govern such systems, but rather to ensure that agencies receive consistent guidance on the identification of systems that should be governed by national security system requirements" (Report of the Committee on Government Reform, U. S House of Representatives, Report 107-787, November 14, 2002, p. 85). Accordingly, the purpose of these guidelines is not to establish requirements for national security systems, but rather to assist agencies in determining which, if any, of their systems are national security systems as defined by FISMA and are to be governed by applicable requirements for such systems, issued in accordance with law and as directed by the President. The guideline includes definitions of relevant terms, the legal or administrative basis for the definitions, a checklist to be used in determining whether or not a system is a national security system, and guidelines for completion of the checklist.},

abstract = {This tutorial paper explores the mechanics of protecting computer-stored information from unauthorized use or modification. It concentrates on those architectural structures-whether hardware or software-that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section II requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysts of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section III, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading.},
