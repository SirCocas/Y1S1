abstract = {Ransomeware is the most prevalent malicious software in 2017 that encrypts the files in a victim's machine and demands money, i.e., ransom, for decrypting the files. The global damage cost and financial losses of individuals and organizations due to ransomware is increasing year by year. Therefore, fighting against ransomware is an urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a ransomware detection scheme using support vector machines (SVMs), which is one of supervised machine learning algorithms. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to let a SVM learn the API calls of ransomware as its features so that the SVM detects unseen ransomware. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme looks into the API call history in more detail. The testbeds using real 276 ransomware with San-box demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the correct detection rate of ransomware.},

abstract = {Recent worldwide cybersecurity attacks caused by Cryptographic Ransomware infected systems across countries and organizations with millions of dollars lost in paying extortion amounts. This form of malicious software takes user files hostage by encrypting them and demands a large ransom payment for providing the decryption key. Signature-based methods employed by Antivirus Software are insufficient to evade Ransomware attacks due to code obfuscation techniques and creation of new polymorphic variants everyday. Generic Malware Attack vectors are also not robust enough for detection as they do not completely track the specific behavioral patterns shown by Cryptographic Ransomware families. This work based on analysis of an extensive dataset of Ran-somware families presents RansomWall, a layered defense system for protection against Cryptographic Ransomware. It follows a Hybrid approach of combined Static and Dynamic analysis to generate a novel compact set of features that characterizes the Ransomware behavior. Presence of a Strong Trap Layer helps in early detection. It uses Machine Learning for unearthing zero-day intrusions. When initial layers of RansomWall tag a process for suspicious Ransomware behavior, files modified by the process are backed up for preserving user data until it is classified as Ransomware or Benign. We implemented RansomWall for Microsoft Windows operating system (the most attacked OS by Cryptographic Ransomware) and evaluated it against 574 samples from 12 Cryptographic Ransomware families in real-world user environments. The testing of RansomWall with various Machine Learning algorithms evaluated to 98.25% detection rate and near-zero false positives with Gradient Tree Boosting Algorithm. It also successfully detected 30 zero-day intrusion samples (having less than 10% detection rate with 60 Security Engines linked to VirusTotal).},

abstract = {Malicious software (malware) has a rich history of causing significant challenges for both users and system developers alike. The development of different malware types is often resulting from criminal opportunity. The monetisation of ransomware, coupled with the continuous growing importance of user data, is resulting in ransomware becoming one of the most prominent forms of malware. Detecting and stopping a ransomware attack is challenging due to the large verity of different types, as well as the speed of new instances being developed. This results in static approaches (e.g. signature-based detection) ineffective at identifying all ransomware instances. This chapter investigates the behavioural characteristics of ransomware, and in particular focusses on interaction with the underlying file system. This study identifies that ransomware instances have unique behavioural patterns, which are significantly different from those of normal user interaction.},

abstract = {Preventive and reactive security measures can only partially mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware attacks. Indeed, the remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cyber-criminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes suggest that a fair number of users are actually paying the ransoms. Unfortunately, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient nowadays, because often we do not have the luxury of being able to isolate a sample to analyze, and when this happens it is already too late for several users! We believe that a forward-looking solution is to equip modern operating systems with practical self-healing capabilities against this serious threat. Towards such a vision, we propose ShieldFS, an add-on driver that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware attacks. For each running process, ShieldFS dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-on-write mechanism, according to the outcome of its detection component. Internally, ShieldFS monitors the low-level filesystem activity to update a set of adaptive models that profile the system activity over time. Whenever one or more processes violate these models, their operations are deemed malicious and the side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back. We designed ShieldFS after an analysis of billions of low-level, I/O filesystem requests generated by thousands of benign applications, which we collected from clean machines in use by real users for about one month. This is the first measurement on the filesystem activity of a large set of benign applications in real working conditions. We evaluated ShieldFS in real-world working conditions on real, personal machines, against samples from state of the art ransomware families. ShieldFS was able to detect the malicious activity at runtime and transparently recover all the original files. Although the models can be tuned to fit various filesystem usage profiles, our results show that our initial tuning yields high accuracy even on unseen samples and variants.},

Using the SMO classifier and PUK kernel in the WEKA machine learning toolset it demonstrates that this methodology can achieve 100% precision when differentiating between ransomware and goodware, and 96.5% when differentiating between five crypto-ransomware families and goodware. Moreover, eight different attribute selection methods are evaluated to achieve significant feature reduction. Using the CorrelationAttributeEval method close to 100% precision can be maintained with a feature reduction of 59.5%. The CFSSubset filter achieves the highest feature reduction of 97.7% however with a slightly lower precision at 94.2%.},

abstract = {Abstract Ransomware, a malware designed to encrypt data for ransom payments, is a potential threat to fog layer nodes as such nodes typically contain considerably amount of sensitive data. The capability to efficiently hunt abnormalities relating to ransomware activities is crucial in the timely detection of ransomware. In this paper, we present our Deep Ransomware Threat Hunting and Intelligence System (DRTHIS) to distinguish ransomware from goodware and identify their families. Specifically, DRTHIS utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), two deep learning techniques, for classification using the softmax algorithm. We then use 220 Locky, 220 Cerber and 220 TeslaCrypt ransomware samples, and 219 goodware samples, to train DRTHIS. In our evaluations, DRTHIS achieves an F-measure of 99.6% with a true positive rate of 97.2% in the classification of ransomware instances. Additionally, we demonstrate that DRTHIS is capable of detecting previously unseen ransomware samples from new ransomware families in a timely and accurate manner using ransomware from the CryptoWall, TorrentLocker and Sage families. The findings show that 99% of CryptoWall samples, 75% of TorrentLocker samples and 92% of Sage samples are correctly classified.},

This type of malware uses cryptographic technology that encrypts a user's important files, folders makes the computer systems unusable, holds the decryption key and asks for the ransom from the victims for recovery. The recent ransomware families are very sophisticated and difficult to analyze & detect using static features only. On the other hand, latest crypto-ransomwares having sandboxing and IDS evading capabilities. So obviously, static or dynamic analysis of the ransomware alone cannot provide better solution. In this paper, we will present a Machine Learning based approach which will use integrated method, a combination of static and dynamic analysis to detect ransomware. The experimental test samples were taken from almost all ransomware families including the most recent “WannaCry”. The results also suggest that combined analysis can detect ransomware with better accuracy compared to individual analysis approach. Since ransomware samples show some “run-time” and “static code” features, it also helps for the early detection of new and similar ransomware variants.},

abstract = {Abstract Cloud computing is one of today's most popular and important IT trends. Currently, most organizations use cloud computing services (public or private) as part of their computer infrastructure. Virtualization technology is at the core of cloud computing, and virtual resources, such as virtual servers, are commonly used to provide services to the entire organization. Due to their importance and prevalence, virtual servers in an organizational cloud are constantly targeted by cyber-attackers who try to inject malicious code or malware into the server (e.g., ransomware). Many times, server administrators are not aware that the server has been compromised, despite the presence of detection solutions on the server (e.g., antivirus engine). In other cases, the breach is detected after a long period of time when significant damage has already occurred. Thus, detecting that a virtual server has been compromised is extremely important for organizational security. Existing security solutions that are installed on the server (e.g., antivirus) are considered untrusted, since malware (particularly sophisticated ones) can evade them. Moreover, these tools are largely incapable of detecting new unknown malware. Machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to be effective at detecting malware in various domains. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for trusted detection of ransomware in virtual servers on an organization's private cloud. We conducted trusted analysis of volatile memory dumps taken from a virtual machine (memory forensics), using the Volatility framework, and created general descriptive meta-features. We leveraged these meta-features, using machine learning algorithms, for the detection of unknown ransomware in virtual servers. We evaluated our methodology extensively in five comprehensive experiments of increasing difficulty, on two different popular servers (IIS server and an email server). We used a collection of real-world, professional, and notorious ransomware and a collection of legitimate programs. The results show that our methodology is able to detect anomalous states of a virtual machine, as well as the presence of both known and unknown ransomware, obtaining the following results: TPR  = 1, FPR  = 0.052, F-measure  = 0.976, and AUC  = 0.966, using the Random Forest classifier. Finally, we showed that our proposed methodology is also capable of detecting an additional type of malware known as a remote access Trojan (RAT), which is used to attack organizational VMs.},

The main objective of this work was to explore the effectiveness of the linear support vector classification (LSVC) in choosing prominent features from an original feature set derived from the Cuckoo sandbox generated behaviour reports. In this work, the proposed malware detection system (MDS) utilizes the Cuckoo sandbox to obtain runtime behaviour report of the Windows executable file to be examined. From the report, features are extracted, and then LSVC is applied onto the extracted features to recognize crucial features, which boost the detection ability of the MDS. The efficiency of the proposed MDS was evaluated using real-world malware samples with tenfold cross-validation tests. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed MDS is proficient in accurately detecting malware and benign executable files by attaining a detection accuracy of 98.429% with the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) classifier.},

abstract = {Emergence of crypto-ransomware has significantly changed the cyber threat landscape. A crypto ransomware removes data custodian access by encrypting valuable data on victims’ computers and requests a ransom payment to re-instantiate custodian access by decrypting data. Timely detection of ransomware very much depends on how quickly and accurately system logs can be mined to hunt abnormalities and stop the evil. In this paper we first setup an environment to collect activity logs of 517 Locky ransomware samples, 535 Cerber ransomware samples and 572 samples of TeslaCrypt ransomware. We utilize Sequential Pattern Mining to find Maximal Frequent Patterns (MFP) of activities within different ransomware families as candidate features for classification using J48, Random Forest, Bagging and MLP algorithms. We could achieve 99 percent accuracy in detecting ransomware instances from goodware samples and 96.5 percent accuracy in detecting family of a given ransomware sample. Our results indicate usefulness and practicality of applying pattern mining techniques in detection of good features for ransomware hunting. Moreover, we showed existence of distinctive frequent patterns within different ransomware families which can be used for identification of a ransomware sample family for building intelligence about threat actors and threat profile of a given target.},

abstract = {Recent statistics show that in 2015 more than 140 millions new malware samples have been found. Among these, a large portion is due to ransomware, the class of malware whose specific goal is to render the victim's system unusable, in particular by encrypting important files, and then ask the user to pay a ransom to revert the damage. Several ransomware include sophisticated packing techniques, and are hence difficult to statically analyse. We present EldeRan, a machine learning approach for dynamically analysing and classifying ransomware. EldeRan monitors a set of actions performed by applications in their first phases of installation checking for characteristics signs of ransomware. Our tests over a dataset of 582 ransomware belonging to 11 families, and with 942 goodware applications, show that EldeRan achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.995. Furthermore, EldeRan works without requiring that an entire ransomware family is available beforehand. These results suggest that dynamic analysis can support ransomware detection, since ransomware samples exhibit a set of characteristic features at run-time that are common across families, and that helps the early detection of new variants. We also outline some limitations of dynamic analysis for ransomware and propose possible solutions.},

abstract = {Ransomware attacks increased in recent years causing significant damages and disruptions to businesses. Forensic analysis such as reverse engineering of executables (or binary files) is the common practice of examining such malware characteristics. In this work, we developed a reverse engineering framework incorporating feature generation engines and machine learning (ML) to efficiently detect ransomware. This framework is used to perform multi-level analysis (such as raw binaries, assembly codes, libraries, and function calls) in order to better examine and interpret the purpose of malware code segments. We leverage the object-code dump tool (Linux) and portable executable (PE) parser to decode binaries to assembly level instructions and dynamic link libraries (DLLs). Both ransomware and normal binaries are considered to conduct experiments where samples are first pre-processed to extract features and then different (supervised) ML techniques are applied to classify these samples. Experimental results reported the performance i.e., the detection accuracy of ransomware samples which varied from 76% to 97% based on the ML technique used. In particular, among the eight ML classifiers tested, seven of these performed well with detection rate of at least 90%. This study also demonstrated that the combination of static level analysis at the ASM-level and DLL-level can better distinguish ransomware from normal binaries.},

We also provide a holistic view on how ransomware attacks have evolved during this period by analyzing 1,359 samples that belong to 15 different ransomware families. Our results show that, despite a continuous improvement in the encryption, deletion, and communication techniques in the main ransomware families, the number of families with sophisticated destructive capabilities remains quite small. In fact, our analysis reveals that in a large number of samples, the malware simply locks the victim's computer desktop or attempts to encrypt or delete the victim's files using only superficial techniques.i?źOur analysis also suggests that stopping advanced ransomware attacks is not as complex as it has been previously reported. For example, we show that by monitoring abnormal file system activity, it is possible to design a practical defense system that could stop a large number of ransomware attacks, even those using sophisticated encryption capabilities. A close examination on the file system activities of multiple ransomware samples suggests that by looking at I/O requests and protecting Master File Table MFT in the NTFS file system, it is possible to detect and prevent a significant number of zero-day ransomware attacks.},

abstract = {The number of ransomware variants has increased rapidly every year, and ransomware needs to be distinguished from the other types of malware to protect users' machines from ransomware‐based attacks. Ransomware is similar to other types of malware in some aspects, but other characteristics are clearly different. For example, ransomware generally conducts a large number of file‐related operations in a short period of time to lock or to encrypt files of a victim's machine. The signature‐based malware detection methods, which have difficulties to detect zero‐day ransomware, are not suitable to protect users' files against the attacks caused by risky unknown ransomware. Therefore, a new protection mechanism specialized for ransomware is needed, and the mechanism should focus on ransomware‐specific operations to distinguish ransomware from other types of malware as well as benign files. This paper proposes a ransomware detection method that can distinguish between ransomware and benign files as well as between ransomware and malware. The experimental results show that our proposed method can detect ransomware among malware and benign files.},

abstract = {Similar to criminals in the physical world, cyber-criminals use a variety of illegal and immoral means to achieve monetary gains. Recently, malware known as ransomware started to leverage strong cryptographic primitives to hold victims' computer files "hostage" until a ransom is paid. Victims, with no way to defend themselves, are often advised to simply pay. Existing defenses against ransomware rely on ad-hoc mitigations that target the incorrect use of cryptography rather than generic live protection. To fill this gap in the defender's arsenal, we describe the approach, prototype implementation, and evaluation of a novel, automated, and most importantly proactive defense mechanism against ransomware. Our prototype, called PayBreak, effectively combats ransomware, and keeps victims' files safe. PayBreak is based on the insight that secure file encryption relies on hybrid encryption where symmetric session keys are used on the victim computer. PayBreak observes the use of these keys, holds them in escrow, and thus, can decrypt files that would otherwise only be recoverable by paying the ransom. Our prototype leverages low overhead dynamic hooking techniques and asymmetric encryption to realize the key escrow mechanism which allows victims to restore the files encrypted by ransomware. We evaluated PayBreak for its effectiveness against twenty hugely successful families of real-world ransomware, and demonstrate that our system can restore all files that are encrypted by samples from twelve of these families, including the infamous CryptoLocker, and more recent threats such as Locky and SamSam. Finally, PayBreak performs its protection task at negligible performance overhead for common office workloads and is thus ideally suited as a proactive online protection system.},

The proposed taxonomy classifies ransomware from three perspectives: severity based, platform based, and target based. Ransomware is a malware category that exploits security mechanisms such as cryptography in order to hijack user files and related resources and demands money in exchange for the locked data. Therefore, ransomware has become a lucrative business that has gained increasing popularity among attackers. Unlike traditional malware, even after removal, ransomware's effect is irreversible and difficult to mitigate without the help of its creator. In addition to the downtime costs and the money that individuals and business entities could pay as a ransom, those victims could incur other damage such as loss of data, reputation, and life. To date, several studies have been conducted to address this unique, challenging threat and have tried to provide detection and prevention solutions. However, there is a lack of survey articles that explore the research endeavors in ransomware and highlight the challenges and issues faced by existing solutions. This survey fills the gap and provides a holistic state-of-the-art review of the research on ransomware and its detection and prevention techniques. The survey puts forward a novel ransomware taxonomy, from several perspectives. It then elaborates on the factors that lead to a successful ransomware attacks before discussing in detail the research into counteracting ransomware, including analysis, prevention, detection and prediction solutions. The survey concludes with a brief discussion on the open issues and potential research directions in the near future.},

abstract = {Although the concept of ransomware is not new (i.e., such attacks date back at least as far as the 1980s), this type of malware has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In fact, in the last few years, a number of high-profile ransomware attacks were reported, such as the large-scale attack against Sony that prompted the company to delay the release of the film "The Interview." Ransomware typically operates by locking the desktop of the victim to render the system inaccessible to the user, or by encrypting, overwriting, or deleting the user's files. However, while many generic malware detection systems have been proposed, none of these systems have attempted to specifically address the ransomware detection problem. 
 
In this paper, we present a novel dynamic analysis system called UNVEIL that is specifically designed to detect ransomware. The key insight of the analysis is that in order to mount a successful attack, ransomware must tamper with a user's files or desktop. UNVEIL automatically generates an artificial user environment, and detects when ransomware interacts with user data. In parallel, the approach tracks changes to the system's desktop that indicate ransomware-like behavior. Our evaluation shows that UNVEIL significantly improves the state of the art, and is able to identify previously unknown evasive ransomware that was not detected by the antimalware industry.},

This book also provides the technical information on cyber-threat detection methods required for the researcher and digital forensics experts, in order to build intelligent automated systems to fight against advanced cybercrimes. 
The ever increasing number of cyber-attacks requires the cyber security and forensic specialists to detect, analyze and defend against the cyber threats in almost real-time, and with such a large number of attacks is not possible without deeply perusing the attack features and taking corresponding intelligent defensive actions – this in essence defines cyber threat intelligence notion. However, such intelligence would not be possible without the aid of artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced data mining techniques to collect, analyze, and interpret cyber-attack campaigns which is covered in this book. This book will focus on cutting-edge research from both academia and industry, with a particular emphasis on providing wider knowledge of the field, novelty of approaches, combination of tools and so forth to perceive reason, learn and act on a wide range of data collected from different cyber security and forensics solutions. This book introduces the notion of cyber threat intelligence and analytics and presents different attempts in utilizing machine learning and data mining techniques to create threat feeds for a range of consumers. Moreover, this book sheds light on existing and emerging trends in the field which could pave the way for future works. 
The interdisciplinary nature of this book, makes it suitable for a wide range of audiences with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, cyber security, forensics, big data and data mining, distributed systems and computer networks.

abstract = {Abstract Ransomware is a special type of malware that can lock victims’ screen and/or encrypt their files to obtain ransoms, resulting in great damage to users. Mapping ransomware into families is useful for identifying the variants of a known ransomware sample and for reducing analysts’ workload. However, ransomware that can fingerprint the environment can evade the precious work of dynamic analysis. To the best of our knowledge, to overcome this shortcoming, we are the first to propose an approach based on static analysis to classifying ransomware. First, opcode sequences from ransomware samples are transformed into N-gram sequences. Then, Term frequency-Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is calculated for each N-gram to select feature N-grams so that these N-grams exhibit better discrimination between families. Finally, we treat the vectors composed of the TF values of the feature N-grams as the feature vectors and subsequently feed them to five machine-learning methods to perform ransomware classification. Six evaluation criteria are employed to validate the model. Thorough experiments performed using real datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve the best Accuracy of 91.43%. Furthermore, the average F1-measure of the “wannacry” ransomware family is up to 99%, and the Accuracy of binary classification is up to 99.3%. The proposed method can detect and classify ransomware that can fingerprint the environment. In addition, we discover that different feature dimensions are required for achieving similar classifier performance with feature N-grams of diverse lengths.},

abstract = {In recent cyber incidents, Ransom software (ransomware) causes a major threat to the security of computer systems. Consequently, ransomware detection has become a hot topic in computer security. Unfortunately, current signature-based and static detection model is often easily evadable by obfuscation, polymorphism, compress, and encryption. For overcoming the lack of signature-based and static ransomware detection approach, we have proposed the dynamic ransomware detection system using data mining techniques such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Simple Logistic (SL) and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms for detecting known and unknown ransomware. We monitor the actual (dynamic) behaviors of software to generate API calls flow graphs (CFG) and transfer it in a feature space. Thereafter, data normalization and feature selection were applied to select informative features which are the best for discriminating between various categories of software and benign software. Finally, the data mining algorithms were used for building the detection model for judging whether the software is benign software or ransomware. Our experimental results show that our proposed system can be more effective to improve the performance for ransomware detection. Especially, the accuracy and detection rate of our proposed system with Simple Logistic (SL) algorithm can achieve to 98.2% and 97.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, the false positive rate also can be reduced to 1.2%.},

abstract = {In spite of being just a few years old, ransomware is quickly becoming a serious threat to our digital infrastructures, data and services. Majority of ransomware families are requesting for a ransom payment to restore a custodian access or decrypt data which were encrypted by the ransomware earlier. Although the ransomware attack strategy seems to be simple, security specialists ranked ransomware as a sophisticated attack vector with many variations and families. Wide range of features which are available in different families and versions of ransomware further complicates their detection and analysis. Though the existing body of research provides significant discussions about ransomware details and capabilities, the all research body is fragmented. Therefore, a ransomware feature taxonomy would advance cyber defenders’ understanding of associated risks of ransomware. In this paper we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first scientific taxonomy of ransomware features, aligned with Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) model. CKC is a well-established model in industry that describes stages of cyber intrusion attempts. To ease the challenge of applying our taxonomy in real world, we also provide the corresponding ransomware defence taxonomy aligned with Courses of Action matrix (an intelligence-driven defence model).

Our approach differs from the above by shifting the focus from removing the problem to mitigating damages, to ensure data availability despite malware attacks. The aim is not to detect new ransomware samples, but simply to protect integrity and availability of private data. In other words, we interfere with ransomware usual behavior, intercepting I/O request packets and denying operations on user's valuable data.},

abstract = {The growth of malware poses a major threat to internet users, governments, and businesses around the world. One of the major types of malware, ransomware, encrypts a user's sensitive information and only returns the original files to the user after a ransom is paid. As malware developers shift the delivery of their product from HTTP to HTTPS to protect themselves from payload inspection, we can no longer rely on deep packet inspection to extract features for malware identification. Toward this goal, we propose a solution leveraging a recent trend in networking hardware, that is programmable forwarding engines (PFEs). PFEs allow collection of per-packet, network monitoring data at high rates. We use this data to monitor the network traffic between an infected computer and the command and control (C&C) server. We extract high-level flow features from this traffic and use this data for ransomware classification. We write a stream processor and use a random forest, binary classifier to utilizes these rich flow records in fingerprinting malicious, network activity without the requirement of deep packet inspection. Our classification model achieves a detection rate in excess of 0.86, while maintaining a false negative rate under 0.11. Our results suggest that a flow-based fingerprinting method is feasible and accurate enough to catch ransomware before encryption.},

In recent years, technologies leveraging software defined networking and programmable hardware have been proposed. These innovations enable operators to get fine-grained insight into every single packet traversing their network at high rates. They generate packet or flow records of all or a subset of traffic in the network and send them to an analytics system that runs specific applications to detect performance or security issues at line rate in a live manner. Unexplored, however, remains the area of detailed, interactive, and retrospective analysis of network records for debugging or auditing purposes. This is likely due to technical challenges in storing and querying large amounts of network monitoring data efficiently. In this work, we study these challenges in more detail. In particular, we explore recent advances in time series databases and find that these systems not only scale to millions of records per second but also allow for expressive queries significantly simplifying practical network debugging and data analysis in the context of computer network monitoring.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) can repeatedly threaten individuals, organisations and national targets, utilising varying tactics and methods to achieve their objectives. This study looks at six such threat groups, namely Shell_Crew, NetTraveler, ProjectSauron, CopyKittens, Volatile Cedar and Transparent Tribe, examines the methods used by each to traverse the cyber kill chain and highlights the array of capabilities that could be employed by adversary targets. Consideration for mitigation and active defence was then made with a view to preventing the effectiveness of the malicious campaigns. The study found that despite the complex nature of some adversaries, often straightforward methods could be employed at various levels in a networked environment to detract from the ability presented by some of the known threats.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) embedded with vulnerable software has raised serious doubts about security of IoT devices and networks. Enhancing fuzzing performance and efficiency to enable testing these software samples is a challenge. Fuzzing is an automated technique widely used to provide software quality assurance during testing to find flaws and bugs by providing random or invalid inputs to a computer software. However, the technique could take significant amount of time and effort to complete during the test phase of the software development lifecycle. Reducing the time required to fuzz a software will improve efficiency and productivity during the software testing phase to enable detailed analysis and fixing of bugs or flaws found in the computer program. There are a number of factors that influence the fuzzing technique, such as quality of test cases or invalid inputs used during the test and how these samples were collected or created. In this paper, we introduce a technique to leverage from the different crashes discovered from two fuzzing approaches to improve fuzzers by concentrating on utilised test cases. The code coverage is used as an efficiency metric to measure the test case on the tested software and to assess the quality of a given input. Different sample features were created and analysed to identify the most effective and efficient feature used as input for the fuzzer program to test the target software.},

abstract = {Botnets are rising as a platform for many unlawful cyber activities such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, malware dissemination, phishing, click fraud, and so on. As of late, detecting botnet has been an intriguing research topic in relation to cybercrime analysis and cyber-threat prevention. This paper is an analysis of publications related to botnet detection techniques. We analyse 194 botnet related papers published between 2009 and 2018 in the ISI Web of Science database. Seven (7) criteria have been used for this analysis to detect highly-cited articles, most impactful journals, current research areas, most active researchers and institutions in the field. It was noted that the average number of publications related to botnet detection have been reduced recently, which could be because of overwhelming existing literature in the field. Asia is the most active and most productive continent in botnet research and computer science is the research area with most publications related to botnet detection as expected.},

abstract = {One of the greatest threats to cyber security is the relatively recent increase in intrusion campaigns conducted by well trained, well-funded and patient adversaries. These groups are known as advanced persistent threats and they are a growing concern for governments and industries around the world. APTs may be backed by terrorist organisations, hacktivists or even nation state actors, conducting covert cyber-warfare against other countries. Due to the advanced capabilities of these groups, a non-targeted, catch-all defence strategy is unlikely to be successful. Instead, potential targets of APTs must be able to research and analyse previous attacks by the groups in order to tailor a cyber defence triage process based on the attacker’s modus operandi. In this paper we attempt to do just that using Diamond Model and kill chain analysis to craft a course of action matrix for three example APT groups.},

abstract = {Various researchers have shown that the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) has many drawbacks and may not provide a precise view of the risks related to software vulnerabilities. However, many threat intelligence platforms and industry-wide standards are relying on CVSS score to evaluate cyber security compliance. This paper suggests several improvements to the calculation of Impact and Exploitability sub-scores within the CVSS, improve its accuracy and help threat intelligence analysts to focus on the key risks associated with their assets. We will apply our suggested improvements against risks associated with several Android and iOS applications and discuss achieved improvements and advantages of our modelling, such as the importance and the impact of time on the overall CVSS score calculation.},

abstract = {In the past few years mobile devices have advanced in a variety of ways such as internal power source capacity, internal memory storage, and CPU capabilities thereby increasing computing capacity while still maintaining a portable size for the owners of mobile devices, this essentially turning it into a portable data storage device where people store their personal information. These changes in the nature and sage of the mobile devices have led to their increased importance in areas such as legal implications in police or company investigations. In this paper we will conduct a bibliometric analysis of the subject of mobile forensics which will enable us to examine the degree to which this new development can become potential evidence, the advances investigators have made over time on the subject, the possible future technologies that could influence more changes in the field of mobile forensics and its impact, covering also the difference between mobile forensics and computer forensics.},
