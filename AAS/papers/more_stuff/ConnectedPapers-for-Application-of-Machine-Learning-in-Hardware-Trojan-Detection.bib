abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs), maliciously inserted in an integrated circuit during untrusted design or fabrication process pose critical threat to the system security. With the ever increasing capabilities of an adversary to subvert the system during run-time, it is imperative to detect the manifested Trojans in order to reinforce the trust in hardware. In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, with their intrinsic capability to execute feature engineering at high learning rates, are emerging as promising candidates to be utilized by system defenders. In this paper, we explore Trojan detection mechanisms that are based on ML, and thereby investigate the prowess of the ML algorithms in bolstering system security. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency of each proposed Trojan detection strategy based on the underlying ML algorithm. Finally, we underline some problems with existing Trojan detection approaches and discuss future research in the interest of improved performance of the employed ML algorithms, thus aiding in enhancing the intended hardware security.},

abstract = {In the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) securing the protection of the supply chain has become an ever-growing concern. One such cyber threat is a Hardware Trojan (HT), a malicious modification to an integrated circuit (IC). HTs are often identified in the hardware manufacturing process, but should be removed earlier, when the design is being specified. Machine learning-based HT detection in gate-level netlists is an efficient approach to identify HTs at the early stage. However, feature-based modeling has limitations in discovering an appropriate set of HT features. We thus propose NHTD-GL in this paper, a novel node-wise HT detection method based on graph learning (GL). Given the formal analysis of HT features obtained from domain knowledge, NHTD-GL bridges the gap between graph representation learning and feature-based HT detection. The experimental results demonstrate that NHTD-GL achieves 0.998 detection accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art node-wise HT detection methods. NHTD-GL extracts HT features without heuristic feature engineering.},

abstract = {Recently, due to the increase of outsourcing in IC design, it has been reported that malicious third-party vendors often insert hardware Trojans into their ICs. How to detect them is a strong concern in IC design process. The features of hardware-Trojan infected nets (or Trojan nets) in ICs often differ from those of normal nets. To classify all the nets in netlists designed by third-party vendors into Trojan ones and normal ones, we have to extract effective Trojan features from Trojan nets. In this paper, we first propose 51 Trojan features which describe Trojan nets from netlists. Based on the importance values obtained from the random forest classifier, we extract the best set of 11 Trojan features out of the 51 features which can effectively detect Trojan nets, maximizing the F-measures. By using the 11 Trojan features extracted, the machine-learning based hardware Trojan classifier has achieved at most 100% true positive rate as well as 100% true negative rate in several TrustHUB benchmarks and obtained the average F-measure of 74.6%, which realizes the best values among existing machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection methods.},

While numerous works have been published over the past decade, few survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, have systematically reviewed the achievements and analyzed the remaining challenges in this area. To fill this gap, this article surveys ML-based approaches against HT attacks available in the literature. In particular, we first provide a classification of all possible HT attacks and then review recent developments from four perspectives, i.e., HT detection, design-for-security (DFS), bus security, and secure architecture. Based on the review, we further discuss the lessons learned in and challenges arising from previous studies. Despite current work focusing more on chip-layer HT problems, it is notable that novel HT threats are constantly emerging and have evolved beyond chips and to the component, device, and even behavior layers, therein compromising the security and trustworthiness of the overall hardware ecosystem. Therefore, we divide the HT threats into four layers and propose a hardware Trojan defense (HTD) reference model from the perspective of the overall hardware ecosystem, therein categorizing the security threats and requirements in each layer to provide a guideline for future research in this direction.},

abstract = {System-on-chip (SoC) developers increasingly rely on pre-verified hardware intellectual property (IP) blocks acquired from untrusted third-party vendors. These IPs might contain hidden malicious functionalities or hardware Trojans to compromise the security of the fabricated SoCs. Recently, supervised machine learning (ML) techniques have shown promising capability in identifying nets of potential Trojans in third party IPs (3PIPs). However, they bring several major challenges. First, they do not guide us to an optimal choice of features that reliably covers diverse classes of Trojans. Second, they require multiple Trojan-free/trusted designs to insert known Trojans and generate a trained model. Even if a set of trusted designs are available for training, the suspect IP could be inherently very different from the set of trusted designs, which may negatively impact the verification outcome. Third, these techniques only identify a set of suspect Trojan nets that require manual intervention to understand the potential threat. In this paper, we present VIPR, a systematic machine learning (ML) based trust verification solution for 3PIPs that eliminates the need for trusted designs for training. We present a comprehensive framework, associated algorithms, and a tool flow for obtaining an optimal set of features, training a targeted machine learning model, detecting suspect nets, and identifying Trojan circuitry from the suspect nets. We evaluate the framework on several Trust-Hub Trojan benchmarks and provide a comparative analysis of detection performance across different trained models, selection of features, and post-processing techniques. The proposed post-processing algorithms reduce false positives by up to 92.85%.},

However, the majority of works either rely on a golden chip, or they rely on methods that are not robust against subtle acceptable changes that would occur over the life-cycle of an integrated circuit (IC). In this paper, we propose using a brain-inspired architecture called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) for HT detection. Similar to the human brain, our proposed solution is resilient against natural changes that might happen in the side-channel measurements while being able to accurately detect abnormal behavior of the chip when the HT gets triggered. We use a self-referencing method for HT detection, which eliminates the need for the golden chip. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated using TrustHub benchmarks, which shows 92.20% detection accuracy on average.},

Naive and compatible testing approaches are required to apprehend the emerging technological issues, and that will ensure high reliability and quality to the systems’ functional behaviors. The unidentified permanent faults, in particular stuck-at faults, have very adverse impacts on the functional quality of circuits under stressful workloads. This paper focuses on the single stuck-at faults simulation and proposing an Artificial-Intelligence (AI) based algorithm for the prediction of Functional Failure Rate (FFR) of each net (netlist wire) for a given set of input patterns. The statistical prediction also provides an improved way of estimating the Functional Fault Coverage (FFC) and the effectiveness of the input test vector. The introduced algorithm is an accelerated methodology which will significantly reduce the time complexity by 60%, while compared to the traditional exhaustive fault-injection approaches.

abstract = {Over the past 10 years, various Hardware Trojan (HT) detection techniques have been proposed by the research community. However, the development of HT benchmark suites for testing and evaluating HT detection techniques lags behind. The number of HT-infected circuits available in current public HT benchmarks is somewhat limited and the circuits lack diversity in structure. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method to generate HTs using a highly configurable generation platform based on transition probability. The generation platform is highly configurable in terms of the HT trigger condition, trigger type, payload type and in the number and variety of HT-infected circuits that can be generated. In this research the transition probability of netlists is employed to identify rarely activated internal nodes to target for HT insertion rather than functional simulation as utilised in previous research. The authors believe transition probability provides a more realistic reflection of the netlist activity for use in determining the appropriate position for HT insertion. Finally, the generated HT-infected circuits are tested by a machine learning (ML)-based HT detection technique, which is known as Controllability and Observability for HT Detection (COTD). The resulting false positive and false negative rates illustrate the feasibility of the benchmark suite.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the prosperity and globalization of the semiconductor industry, hardware security issues have become another major problem besides software security. To reduce the development costs, integrated circuits are often outsourced to various external vendors. This provides malicious third-party vendors a good chance to implant Trojans in the circuit design and manufacture phases. It is crucial to find effective solution to hardware Trojan detection. This paper proposes a hybrid hardware Trojan detection method for gate-level netlist based on XGBoost algorithm. The detection method affirms each network as a node and aims to detect all Trojan networks existing in the circuit. Firstly, according to the difference between the features of the Trojan circuit and the normal circuit, the effective features of the circuit are extracted. Then the XGBoost algorithm is applied to train the optimum feature set and classify the circuit into suspicious Trojan circuits and normal circuits. To obtain a higher accuracy, the dynamic detection method is applied to make up for the shortcomings of the static detection. The experimental results on the Trust-HUB benchmarks show that the detection method can achieve accurate detection of hardware Trojan circuits. The detection method can finally achieve 90.9% average True Positive Rate (TPR) and 99.0% average True Negative Rate (TNR).},

abstract = {Hardware design, especially the very large scale integration(VLSI) and systems on chip design(SOC), utilizes many codes from third-party intellectual property (IP) providers and former designers. Hardware Trojans (HTs) are easily inserted in this process. Recently researchers have proposed many HTs detection techniques targeting the design codes. State-of-art detections are based on the testability including Controllability and Observability, which are effective to all HTs from TrustHub, and advanced HTs like DeTrust. Meanwhile, testability based detections have advantages in the timing complexity and can be easily integrated into recently industrial verification. Undoubtedly, the adversaries will upgrade their designs accordingly to evade these detection techniques. Designing a variety of complex trojans is a significant way to perfect the existing detection, therefore, we present a novel design of HTs to defeat the testability based detection methods, namely DeTest. Our approach is simple and straight forward, yet it proves to be effective at adding some logic. Without changing HTs malicious function, DeTest decreases controllability and observability values to about 10% of the original, which invalidates distinguishers like clustering and support vector machines (SVM). As shown in our practical attack results, adversaries can easily use DeTest to upgrade their HTs to evade testability based detections. Combined with advanced HTs design techniques like DeTrust, DeTest can evade previous detecions, like UCI, VeriTrust and FANCI. We further discuss how to extend existing solutions to reduce the threat posed by DeTest.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans inserted at the time of design or fabrication by untrustworthy design house or foundry, poses important security concerns. With the increase in attacker's resources and capabilities, we can anticipate an unexpected new attack from the attacker at run-time. Therefore, the challenge is not only to reduce hardware overhead of added security feature but also to secure design from new attacks introduced at real-time. In this work, we propose a Real-time Online Learning approach for Securing many-core design. In order to prevent unexpected attacks, many-core provides feed-back to online learning algorithm based on core information and its behavior to incoming data packet. The proposed Online Learning approach updates the model run-time at each data transfer based on feed-back from many-core. For demonstration, Online Machine Learning model is initially trained with two types of (known) attacks and Trojan free router packets and then unexpected attack is introduced later at run-time. The results show that, feedback based Online Machine Learning algorithm has 8% higher overall detection accuracy and an average of 3% higher accuracy for unexpected attacks at each interval of 1000 test records than Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. The proposed feed-back based Trojan detection framework is demonstrated using a custom many-core architecture integrated with “Modified Balanced Winnow” Online Machine Learning algorithm on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Post place and route implementation results show that, secured many-core architecture requires 4 extra cycles to complete data transfer. The proposed architecture achieves 56% reduction in area and 50% less latency overhead as compared to previous published work [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate our framework for many-core platform by employing seizure detection application as a case study.},

abstract = {As the globalization of chip design and manufacturing process becomes popular, malicious hardware inclusions such as hardware Trojans pose a serious threat to the security of digital systems. Advanced Trojans can mask many architectural-level Trojan signatures and adapt against several detection mechanisms. Runtime Trojan detection techniques are considered as a last line of defense against Trojan inclusion and activation. In this article, we propose an offline analysis to select a subset of flip-flops as surrogates and build an anomaly detection model based on the activity profile of flip-flops. These flip-flops are monitored online, and the anomaly detection model implemented online analyzes the flip-flop data to detect any anomalous Trojan activity. The effectiveness of our approach has been tested on several Trojan-inserted designs of the Leon3 processor. Trojan activation is detected with an accuracy score of above 0.9 (ratio of the number of true predictions to total number of predictions) with no false positives by monitoring less than 0.5% of the total number of flip-flops.},

Using an unsupervised clustering analysis, the paper shows that the controllability and observability characteristics of Trojan gates present significant inter-cluster distance from those of genuine gates in a Trojan-inserted circuit, such that Trojan gates are easily distinguishable. The proposed technique does not require any golden model and can be easily integrated into the current integrated circuit design flow. Furthermore, it performs a static analysis and does not require any test pattern application for Trojan activation either partially or fully. In addition, the timing complexity of the proposed technique is an order of the number of signals in a circuit. Moreover, the proposed technique makes it possible to fully restore an inserted Trojan and to isolate its trigger and payload circuits. The technique has been applied on various types of Trojans, and all Trojans are successfully detected with 0 false positive and negative rates in less than 14 s in the worst case.},

abstract = {Nowadays malicious vendors can easily insert hardware Trojans into integrated circuit chips as the entire integrated chip supply chain involves numerous design houses and manufacturers on a global scale. It is thereby becoming a necessity to expose any possible hardware Trojans, if they ever exist in a chip. A typical Trojan circuit is made of a trigger and a payload that are interconnected with a trigger net. As trigger net can be viewed as the signature of a hardware Trojan, in this paper, we propose a gate-level hardware Trojan detection method and model that can be applied to screen the entire chip for trigger nets. In specific, we extract the trigger-net features for each net from known netlists and use the machine learning method to train multiple detection models according to the trigger modes. The detection models are used to identify suspicious trigger nets from the netlist of the integrated circuit under detection, and score each net in terms of suspiciousness value. By flagging the top 2% suspicious nets with the highest suspiciousness values, we shall be able to detect majority hardware Trojans, with an average accuracy rate of 96%.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new formal method for detecting and identifying hardware Trojans (HTs) inserted into the datapath of cryptographic hardware based on Galois-field arithmetic such as for the Advanced Encryption Standard and elliptic curve cryptography. To detect HTs, our method first performs equivalence checking between the specifications given as Galois-field polynomials (or the reference circuit of cryptographic hardware) and polynomials representing the input-output relations of a gate-level netlist. Our method exploits zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams for efficient verification. Once an HT is found, the proposed method then detects the trigger condition of the HT using the characteristics of zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams. It also identifies the HT localization using a novel computer algebra method. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can verify netlists and identify HT trigger conditions and locations on a 233-bit multiplier commonly used in elliptic curve cryptography within 1.8 seconds. In addition, we show that if the reference circuit is given, the proposed method can detect a realistic HT inserted into the entire Advanced Encryption Standard hardware, including control logic, in approximately three seconds.},

abstract = {Recently, the design and manufacturing of ICs are mostly outsourced to third-party design houses and foundries due to the tedious and costly processes. This makes the IC design and manufacturing chain to be vulnerable to hardware Trojan intrusion by third-party vendors with malicious intentions. In design phase, gate-level netlist checking is important to spot the existence of any suspicious nets in the netlist. Thus, highly Trojan-correlated features and efficient learning algorithms are needed to classify each net effectively. Testability measures are proven as efficient features for Trojan net classification, but the problem of imbalanced training data remains. Also, the extracted Sandia Controllability and Observability Analysis Program (SCOAP) values are restricted to a low threshold. In this paper, we extract the SCOAP values without a limited threshold and normalize the extraction data using Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Technique (ADASYN) for better learning in supervised algorithms. Using the best performing classifier which is Bagged Trees, we are able to achieve overall 99.97% True Positive Rate (TPR), 99.81% True Negative Rate (TNR) and 99.9% Accuracy (ACC) with the results validated using 10-fold cross-validation.},

abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) are acknowledged as a significant emerging security concern in the IC industry resulting from the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain. Recently, taking advantage of the exponential growth in computing power, machine learning (ML) approaches such as neural networks (NNs) are being considered for HT detection. However, the circuit structure and components of an IC design are different from the data types in the ML models. To efficiently extract HT features from complex IC designs and utilize common ML-based detection approaches is challenging. In this paper, a novel HT feature extraction strategy based on gate-level circuit netlists is proposed to tackle the challenges. The HT features are extracted from the circuit topology rather than statistical analysis in previous research. A commonly utilized support vector machine (SVM)-based HT detection model is employed for data training and testing using the extracted features on HT benchmarks from both open-sourced library and HT generation platform to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed HT feature extraction strategy. The detection results show high recall in nearly all tested benchmarks, achieving at most 97.7% recall on sequential Trojans and 84.8% on combinational ones.},

abstract = {Increasing reliance on hardware Intellectual Property (IP) cores in modern system-on-chip (SoC) design flow, often obtained from untrusted vendors distributed across the globe, can significantly compromise the security of SoCs. While the design could be verified for a specified functionality using existing tools, it is extremely hard to verify its trustworthiness to guarantee that no hidden, and possibly malicious function exists in the form of a hardware Trojan. Conventional verification process and tools fail to verify the trust of a third-party IP, primarily due to the lack of trusted reference design or golden models. In this paper, for the first time to our knowledge, we introduce a systematic framework to apply machine learning based classification for hardware IP trust verification. A supervised classifier could be trained for identifying Trojan nets within a suspect IP, but the detection coverage and accuracy are extremely sensitive to the quality of training set available. Furthermore, reliance on a static training database limits the classifier’s ability in detecting new Trojans and facilitates adversarial learning. The proposed framework includes a Trojan insertion tool that dynamically generates a large number of diverse implementations of Trojan classes for creating a robust training set. It is significantly more difficult for an adversary to evade our classifier using known Trojan classes since the tool dynamically samples the entire Trojan population. To further improve the efficiency of the system, we combined three machine learning models into an average probability Voting Ensemble. Our results for two broad classes of Trojan show excellent classification accuracy of 99.69% and 99.88% with F-score of 86.69% and 88.37% for sequential and combinational Trojans, respectively.},

abstract = {The challenges of custom integrated circuits (IC) design have made it prevalent to integrate commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (micro-controllers, FPGAs, etc.) in today’s designs. While this approach eases the design challenges and improves productivity, it also gives rise to diverse security concerns. One such concern is the possibility of malicious hardware modifications, also called hardware Trojan attacks, by untrusted parties involved in the manufacturing or distribution of COTS devices. While Hardware Trojan detection is an active research topic in the field of microelectronics security, most methods assume the availability of a golden design/chip, which is impractical in the case of a COTS device. In this paper, we discuss challenges with detecting Trojan in COTS components, and introduce a Trojan detection method that applies unsupervised learning. We utilize side-channel power signatures to cluster and isolate chips with Trojans. The proposed method is suitable for trust verification of COTS components by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) before system integration. In our method, the design house creates a set of security validation test vectors available to the tester (e.g., OEM). The OEM can also generate the test vectors using the block-level diagrams provided by the design house. Power signatures are generated for all the chips under test using these test vectors. We use the generated power signatures to apply feature extraction followed by clustering to group the chips into bins. Through this process, we divide the chips into distinct bins and distinguish the Trojan-inserted chips from the Trojan-free ones. The bin with golden chips can be identified by extensive testing and reverse engineering of one chip sampled from each bin. We utilize two clustering techniques K-Means, and Expectation-Maximization (EM) to perform a comparative analysis. Additionally, we perform extensive experiments to assert our method’s effectiveness and obtain over 98% accuracy on the clustering of FPGA chips with both combinational and sequential Trojans.},

abstract = {Recent trends in integrated circuits industry include decentralization of the production flow by involving different integration teams, third-party IP vendors and other untrusted entities. As a result, this is opening up a door to new types of attacks that may lead to devastating consequences, such as denial of service or data leakage. Therefore, the problem of ensuring hardware security has gained much attention in the last years, especially early in the design cycle, when an attacker may insert malicious circuitry at register transfer (RT) or gate level. Due to the increased complexity of modern devices, the research community is spending a lot of effort in developing more sophisticated detection methodologies and smarter attacks. However, the main problem is that they are validated on the existing benchmarks that do not reflect the real complexity. Trying to fill this gap, this paper proposes a set of RT-Level Hardware Trojan benchmarks injected in a RISC-based pipelined microprocessor core. To prove the viability, the impacts on area, power and frequency are presented and discussed. For any proposed Hardware Trojan, the functional description, the implementation details and the effects once activated are provided.},

abstract = {The involvement of external vendors during the different phases of the integrated circuits (IC) allows the adversaries to insert the hardware Trojan (HT). Existing HT detection techniques fail to detect Trojans accurately, time-consuming, does not handle class imbalance problem efficiently, use tree-based feature importance, and possess large false positive and negative rates. Therefore, to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a new class weighted Extreme Gradient Boosting (CW-XGB) based HT detection technique, which detects Trojans from gate-level netlist using the best set of SCOAP feature values. A weighting scheme is proposed in the CW-XGB model to tackle class imbalance problem by assigning higher weights to minority Trojan-inserted class, thus removing the need to apply the oversampling/synthetic data algorithm. Moreover, the proposed model automatically addresses the overfitting issue by incorporating the regularization in the loss function. Besides, we also employ early stopping to avoid the over-training of the proposed model. Further, a new feature selection method is proposed, which selects the best set of SCOAP features based on permutation feature importance values, and it also avoids the continuous retraining of the model. Finally, a new HT detection algorithm is proposed that accurately detects HT from gate-level netlist using the best set of features and proposed CW-XGB model. Experimental results on Trust-Hub benchmarks shows that the proposed HT detection technique provides on an average 99%, 98.86%, and 99% accuracy, precision, and recall, respectively. Further, it provides on an average 98.76% and 98.73% F-measure and ROC-AUC score, respectively.},

abstract = {Recently, there are various methods for detecting the hardware trojans (HTs) in the integrated circuits (ICs). The circuit’s logic representations of different types, structures, and functional characteristics should be different. Each type of circuit has its’ own performance characteristics according to its’ purpose. However, the traditional HTs detection methods adopt the same approach to deal with the multi-purpose hardware trojan. At the same time, as the scale of integrated circuits growing, the structures are more complex, and the functions are more refined. The current situation makes the traditional HTs detection methods weaker and even unfeasible. Therefore, we propose an HTs classified locating method based on machine learning, named ML-HTCL, which belongs to the static detection and locating method. In ML-HTCL, different purpose HTs were represented by different features. Due to the different features, the ML-HTCL employs the multi-layer BP neural network for the control signal type HTs and the one-class SVM for the information leakage HTs, respectively. To deal with the HTs completely, the boundary nets are considered for all data set, while those were ignored by the most existing methods due to the high detection error rate. After detection, the HTs’ precise locations were achieved. To evaluate the ML-HTCL, 17 gate-level netlist benchmarks are used for training and testing by leave-one-out cross-validation. From the results, the ML-HTCL reaches 85.05% of TPR and 73.91% of TNR for all kinds of HTs, which performs better than the most existing methods.},

Then we classify the nets in an unknown netlist into a set of normal nets and Trojan nets based on the random-forest classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that the average true positive rate (TPR) becomes 63.6% and the average true negative rate (TNR) becomes 100.0%.

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed remarkable research advances at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and hardware security. The confluence of the two technologies has created many interesting and unique opportunities, but also left some issues in their wake. ML schemes have been extensively used to enhance the security and trust of embedded systems like hardware Trojans and malware detection. On the other hand, ML-based approaches have also been adopted by adversaries to assist side-channel attacks, reverse engineer integrated circuits and break hardware security primitives like Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Deep learning is a subfield of ML. It can continuously learn from a large amount of labeled data with a layered structure. Despite the impressive outcomes demonstrated by deep learning in many application scenarios, the dark side of it has not been fully exposed yet. The inability to fully understand and explain what has been done within the super-intelligence can turn an inherently benevolent system into malevolent. Recent research has revealed that the outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be easily corrupted by imperceptibly small input perturbations. As computations are brought nearer to the source of data creation, the attack surface of DNN has also been extended from the input data to the edge devices. Accordingly, due to the opportunities of ML-assisted security and the vulnerabilities of ML implementation, in this paper, we will survey the applications, vulnerabilities and fortification of ML from the perspective of hardware security. We will discuss the possible future research directions, and thereby, sharing a roadmap for the hardware security community in general.},

Faults which are to be added to or removed from the set of suspected faults are determined using single fault simulation. Diagnosis is effected by repeated additions and removals of faults. The effectiveness of the method of diagnosis has been evaluated by experiments conducted on benchmark circuits. The proposed method achieves a small number of suspected faults by simple processing.

The number of circuit diagnoses that need to be performed dynamically, without the use of precomputed knowledge, before the overall diagnosis effort exceeds the effort of computing a dictionary, is studied. Experimental results on ISCAS-85 circuits show that for relatively small numbers of diagnoses, a precomputed dictionary is more efficient than dynamic diagnosis. Next, a method to derive small dictionaries without losing resolution of modeled faults is proposed, based on extended pass/fail analysis. The same procedure is applicable for selecting internal observation points to increase the resolution of the test set. Methods to compact the resulting dictionary further, using compaction techniques generally applied to fault detection, are then described. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

In order to reduce the number of lines to be probed by the EB tester, the proposed method selects internal lines to be probed by using a backward path tracing procedure. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a small number of suspected faults by probing a small number of internal lines.},

abstract = {Diagnosing multiple stuck-at faults in combinational circuits using singleand multiple-fault simulation is proposed. The proposed method adds (removes) faults from a set of suspected faults depending on the result of multiple-fault simulation at a primary output agreeing (disagreeing) with the observed value. However, the faults that are added or removed from the set of suspected faults are determined using single-fault simulation. Diagnosis is carried out by repeated addition and removal of faults. The effectiveness of the diagnosis method is evaluated by experiments conducted on benchmark circuits and it is found to be substantially superior compared to the previous known solutions. The method proposed in this paper can be used as a powerful tool at the preprocessing stage of diagnosis in an electron-beam tester environment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we improve the previous method by enhancing a set of diagnostic tests and using an EB testing method. We first enhance the previous set of diagnostic tests to one of diagnostic tests consisting of the four sets, TP-1, TP-2, TP-3 and TP-4. We next present two diagnostic methods by using the enhanced diagnostic tests and an electron-beam tester (EB-tester). Experimental results show that the presented method identified fault locations within 0.2 to 5% of all stuck-at faults on all lines in the circuit by probing about 0.8 to 15% internal lines.},

abstract = {The paper presents an approach to multiple fault diagnosis in sequential circuits by using input sequence pairs having sensitizing input pairs. This represents an extension of our previous work dealing with combinational circuits (N. Yanagida et al., 1995). After reviewing our previous method, we introduce an input sequence pair having sensitizing input pairs to diagnose multiple faults in a sequential circuit partitioned into subcircuits. We call such an input sequence pair, the sensitizing sequence pair. Next, we extend the use of the previous method for combinational circuits to sequential circuits. From a relation between a sensitizing path generated by a sensitizing sequence pair and a subcircuit, the proposed method deduces the suspected faults for the subcircuits, one by one, based on the responses observed at primary outputs without probing any internal line. The paper provides the first experimental reports on diagnostic results of the ISCAS circuits by using our diagnostic method for sequential circuits, without probing any internal line, any fault simulation, or fault enumeration.},

Experimental evaluation of the algorithm on ISCAS circuits is presented.},

abstract = {We present two techniques for improving the efficiency of the previous method for multiple fault diagnosis of combinational circuits. (1) Three new rules for deducing the valves at the internal lines are added to the previous deduction rules. Experimental results show that 2.6/spl sim/15.2% improvements in resolution are achieved by adding the enhanced deduction rules without probing the internal lines. (2) A probing method for diagnosis is proposed to improve the resolution obtained by the method (1). Preliminary experimental results show that about 0.1/spl sim/9.4% improvements in resolution are further achieved by probing about 4/spl sim/111 internal lines in the circuit.<<ETX>>},
