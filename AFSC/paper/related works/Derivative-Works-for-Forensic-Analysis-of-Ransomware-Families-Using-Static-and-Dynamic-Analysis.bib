abstract = {
 The COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed a huge surge in the number of ransomware attacks. Different institutions such as healthcare, financial, and government have been targeted. There can be numerous reasons for such a sudden rise in attacks, but it appears working remotely in home-based environments (which is less secure compared to traditional institutional networks) could be one of the reasons. Cybercriminals are constantly exploring different approaches like social engineering attacks, such as phishing attacks, to spread ransomware. Hence, in this paper, we explored recent advances in ransomware prevention and detection and highlighted future research challenges and directions. We also carried out an analysis of a few popular ransomware samples and developed our own experimental ransomware, AESthetic, that was able to evade detection against eight popular antivirus programs.

abstract = {Ransomware remains an alarming threat in the 21st century. It has evolved from being a simple scare tactic into a complex malware capable of evasion. Formerly, end-users were targeted via mass infection campaigns. Nevertheless, in recent years, the attackers have focused on targeted attacks, since the latter are profitable and can induce severe damage. A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used. Finally, we propose a roadmap for researchers to fill the gaps found in the literature in ransomware’s battle.},

abstract = {The cryptography employed against user files makes the effect of crypto-ransomware attacks irreversible even after detection and removal. Thus, detecting such attacks early, i.e. during pre-encryption phase before the encryption takes place is necessary. Existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions use a fixed time-based thresholding approach to determine the pre-encryption phase boundaries. However, the fixed time thresholding approach implies that all samples start the encryption at the same time. Such assumption does not necessarily hold for all samples as the time for the main sabotage to start varies among different crypto-ransomware families due to the obfuscation techniques employed by the malware to change its attack strategies and evade detection, which generates different attack behaviors. Additionally, the lack of sufficient data at the early phases of the attack adversely affects the ability of feature extraction techniques in early detection models to perceive the characteristics of the attacks, which, consequently, decreases the detection accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a Dynamic Pre-encryption Boundary Delineation and Feature Extraction (DPBD-FE) scheme that determines the boundary of the pre-encryption phase, from which the features are extracted and selected more accurately. Unlike the fixed thresholding employed by the extant works, DPBD-FE tracks the pre-encryption phase for each instance individually based on the first occurrence of any cryptography-related APIs. Then, an annotated Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (aTF-IDF) technique was utilized to extract the features from runtime data generated during the pre-encryption phase of crypto-ransomware attacks. The aTF-IDF overcomes the challenge of insufficient attack patterns during the early phases of the attack lifecycle. The experimental evaluation shows that DPBD-FE was able to determine the pre-encryption boundaries and extract the features related to this phase more accurately compared to related works.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is characterized by its irreversible effect even after the detection and removal. As such, the early detection is crucial to protect user data and files of being held to ransom. Several solutions have proposed utilizing the data extracted during the initial phases of the attacks before the encryption takes place. However, the lack of enough data at the early phases of the attack along with high dimensional features space renders the model prone to overfitting which decreases its detection accuracy. To this end, this paper proposed a novel redundancy coefficient gradual up-weighting approach that was incorporated to the calculation of redundancy term of mutual information to improve the feature selection process and enhance the accuracy of the detection model. Several machine learning classifiers were used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed techniques. The experimental results show that the accuracy of proposed techniques achieved higher detection accuracy. Those results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques for the early detection tasks.},

abstract = {Crypto-ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts user files, deletes the original data, and asks for a ransom to recover the hijacked documents. It is a cyber threat that targets both companies and residential users, and has spread in recent years because of its lucrative results. Several articles have presented classifications of ransomware families and their typical behaviour. These insights have stimulated the creation of detection techniques for antivirus and firewall software. However, because the ransomware scene evolves quickly and aggressively, these studies quickly become outdated. In this study, we surveyed the detection techniques that the research community has developed in recent years. We compared the different approaches and classified the algorithms based on the input data they obtain from ransomware actions, and the decision procedures they use to reach a classification decision between benign or malign applications. This is a detailed survey that focuses on detection algorithms, compared to most previous studies that offer a survey of ransomware families or isolated proposals of detection algorithms. We also compared the results of these proposals.},

abstract = {Abstract Traditional non-semantic file systems are not sufficient in protecting file systems against attacks, either caused by ransomware attacks or software-related defects. Furthermore, outbreaks of new malware often cannot provide a large quantity of training samples for machine-learning-based approaches to counter malware campaigns. The malware defense system should aim to achieve the best balance between early detection and detection accuracy. In this paper, we present a situation-aware access control framework to work with existing file systems as a stackable add-on. Our framework enables the access control decision making to be deferred when required, to observe the consequence of such an access request to the file system and to roll back changes if required. As an application against ransomware attacks, it can be applied to preserve file content integrity, by enforcing that all binary files written to the file system have consistent internal file structures with the declared file types, and rolling back changes that violate such constraints. We envision our access control framework to complement existing operating system access control frameworks, to significantly reduce the dimension of data required for machine learning, and to build extra resilience into the operating systems against damages caused by either malware or software defects. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework through a prototype testing, capturing relevant ransomware situations. The experimental results along with a large ransomware dataset show that our framework can be effectively applied in practice.},

abstract = {Abstract Ransomware attacks are often catastrophic, yet existing reactive and preventative measures could only partially mitigate ransomware damage, often not in a timely manner, and often cannot prevent the novel attack vectors. Many of them were program-centric or data-centric and did not take into consideration user intention or consent. In this paper, we advocate for a dynamic approach of detecting ransomware-like behaviors by proposing a user-centric access control framework, which collects security indicators from the Operating System (OS) to deduct security metrics, compute security indicators and estimate security positions, to dynamically make access control assessments on file access requests. To demonstrate its applicability, we effectuated the principles of User-Driven Access Control (UDAC) for user intention (the goal of a user operation) and Content-Based Isolation (CBI) for user consent (the acceptance of the consequence of a user operation), and developed a proof-of-concept prototype on Windows desktop platforms. It collected information that could reveal the application identity, behavior and the OS environmental factor, before assessing whether an access request to the file system violated the principles of UDAC or CBI. Our prototype was able to raise early warnings on both attacks by real and simulated ransomware of novel vectors.},

abstract = {Ransomware is among the most dangerous malware prevailing in today’s world. Once infected, the malware either encrypts the data or lock the system screen, and prevents the owner from accessing his data and system until some ransom money is paid, resulting in multi-million dollars of cyber-extortion annually. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the owner would regain access to the seized data after payment is made. Ransomware attacks keep troubling the cybersecurity community; researchers are working towards developing efficient techniques for the detection and prevention of ransomware attacks. In this paper, we are attempting to review the existing solutions based on the methodology adopted and validate them using specific performance metrics.},

abstract = {Nowadays ransomware has become a new profitable form of attack. This type of malware acts as a form of extortion which encrypts the files in a victim’s computer and forces the victim to pay the ransom to have the data recovered. Even companies and tech savvy people must use extensive resources to maintain backups for recovery or else they will lose valuable data, not mentioning average users. Unfortunately, not any recovery tool can effectively defend various types of ransomware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ransomware defense mechanism that can be easily deployed in modern Windows system to recover the data and mitigate a ransomware attack. The uniqueness of our approach is to fight the virus like a virus. We leverage Alternative Data Streams which are sometimes used by malicious applications, to develop a data protection method that misleads the ransomware to attack only file ’shells’ instead of the actual file content. We evaluated different file encrypting ransomware and demonstrate usability, efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.},
