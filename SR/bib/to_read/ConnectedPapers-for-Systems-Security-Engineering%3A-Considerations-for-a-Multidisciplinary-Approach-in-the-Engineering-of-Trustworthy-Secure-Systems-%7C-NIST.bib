abstract = {The state of the science of information security is astonishingly rich with solutions and tools to incrementally and selectively solve hard problems. In contrast, the state of the actual application of science, and the general knowledge and understanding of existing science, is lamentably poor. Still we face a dramatically growing dependence on information technology, e.g., the Internet, that attracts a steadily emerging threat of well-planned, coordinated hostile attacks. A series of hard-won scientific advances gives us the ability to field systems having verifiable protection, and an understanding of how to powerfully leverage verifiable protection to meet pressing system security needs. Yet, we as a community lack the discipline, tenacity and will to do the hard work to effectively deploy such systems. Instead, we pursue pseudoscience and flying pigs. In summary, the state of science in computer and network security is strong, but it suffers unconscionable neglect.},

The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources. The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system. Audience Program managers, system owners, and security personnel in the organization must understand the system security planning process. In addition, users of the information system and those responsible for defining system requirements should be familiar with the system security planning process. Those responsible for implementing and managing information systems must participate in addressing security controls to be applied to their systems. This guidance provides basic information on how to prepare a system security plan and is designed to be adaptable in a variety of organizational structures and used as reference by those having assigned responsibility for activity related to security planning.

Namun terdapat permasalahan dalam penggunaan TI yang ada saat ini antara lain : (1) Masih sering terjadinya insiden keamanan informasi yang menyebabkan terganggunya proses bisnis perusahaan, (2) Belum adanya pengawasan dan perencanaan yang tepat dalam pengelolaan keamanan informasi di STMIK Sumedang. Manajemen resiko adalah metode untuk penilaian dan mitigasi resiko terhadap aspek kebutuhan keamanan informasi yang memuat 3 unsur penting yaitu : Confidentiality (kerahasiaan), Integrity (integritas), dan Availability (ketersediaan). Manajemen resiko keamanan informasi yang digunakan mengacu pada NIST SP 800-30 Revisi 1. Standar ini digunakan sebagai acuan dalam melakukan manajemen resiko keamanan informasi, untuk mengantisipasi risiko agar kerugian tidak terjadi terhadap organisasi. Sehingga resiko dapat dikelola ke level yang dapat diterima organisasi. Diharapkan akan mengurangi dampak insiden sistem dan teknologi informasi di institusi perguruan tinggi, melindungi proses bisnis organisasi yang penting dari ancaman keamanan, meminimalisir risiko kerugian serta menghindari kegagalan serius terhadap informasi yang ada di STMIK Sumedang. Setelah dilakukan manajemen risiko maka diperlukan control keamanan sebagai dasar acuan bahwa risiko dilakukan mitigasi, diterima/ditransfer oleh pihak manajemen. Kontrol keamanan dikembangkan dari ISO 27002. Untuk mengetahui sejauh mana keamanan informasi organisasi maka dilakukan maturity keamanan informasi organisasi menggunakan control yang dikembangkan dari ISO 27002. Dari hasil maturity ini menjadi dasar dibuatnya rekomendasi standar kebijakan keamanan informasi di STMIK Sumedang.},

We focus on a concise summary articulation of the principles as they apply to the development of the most elemental components of a basic security system. The results are organized into several major categories: structure, logic and function, system lifecycle, and lessons learned.},

abstract = {Abstract : Computer security addresses the problem of enforcement of security policies in the presence of malicious users and software. Systems enforcing mandatory policies can create confinement domains that limit the damage incurred by malicious software executing in applications. To achieve assurance that the confinement domains cannot be breached, the underlying enforcement mechanism must be constructed to ensure that it is resistant to penetration by malicious software and is free of malicious artifacts. The limitations and contributions of testing in achieving these goals are discussed. Why would a national software testing laboratory advertise on its web page that it provides testing for functionality, compatibility, performance, scalability, and fault tolerance, but not security? The answer may lie in the fact that certain aspects of security policy can be described in completely non-subjective terms. For example, the policy may state that unauthorized individuals are not permitted to read classified material. Can testing ensure that policy will not be violated? This paper provides an overview of challenges that security poses to testing and describes the role of testing in the engineering of trustworthy systems.},

abstract = {The National Cyber Range (NCR) is an innovative Department of Defense (DoD) resource originally established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and now under the purview of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC). It provides a unique environment for cyber security testing throughout the program development life cycle using unique methods to assess resiliency to advanced cyberspace security threats. This paper describes what a cyber security range is, how it might be employed, and the advantages a program manager (PM) can gain in applying the results of range events. Creating realism in a test environment isolated from the operational environment is a special challenge in cyberspace. Representing the scale and diversity of the complex DoD communications networks at a fidelity detailed enough to realistically portray current and anticipated attack strategies (e.g., Malware, distributed denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting) is complex. The NCR addresses this challenge by representing an Internet-like environment by employing a multitude of virtual machines and physical hardware augmented with traffic emulation, port/protocol/service vulnerability scanning, and data capture tools. Coupled with a structured test methodology, the PM can efficiently and effectively engage with the Range to gain cyberspace resiliency insights. The NCR capability, when applied, allows the DoD to incorporate cyber security early to avoid high cost integration at the end of the development life cycle. This paper provides an overview of the resources of the NCR which may be especially helpful for DoD PMs to find the best approach for testing the cyberspace resiliency of their systems under development.},

This thesis provides a demonstration implementation of a Trusted Path for Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and is used to examine trusted paths, their design and implementation. Additionally, the effectiveness of a Trusted Path for SELinux is analyzed. This research is meant to provide a framework that could be used in combination with other efforts to enhance the security of SELinux.},

abstract = {Abstract : Time is often a critical factor for making decisions regarding access to information. To manage and protect critical data in this regard implies that information systems need to enforce temporal security policies. However, we lack operating system and hardware support for implementing temporal protection mechanisms. A time interval memory protection architecture to support enforcement of temporal policies is presented. It implements a Time Interval Access Control model in which authorizations are determined by time attributes associated with subjects and objects, and constraints on the relations of those attributes relative to the time of access. The policy is enforced at the memory page level by kernel mechanisms and related hardware extensions. The notion of memory access phases and the principle of efficiently mediated access are articulated to support the analysis of the design. A simulator-based prototype shows that the architecture is both feasible and practical.},

abstract = {The threats to government computer systems and networks continue to evolve and grow due to steady advances in the sophistication of attack technology, the ease of obtaining such technology, and the increasing use of these techniques by state and nonstate actors to gain intelligence and/or disrupt operations. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) cites that from 2006 to 2012, the number of cyberincidents reported by federal agencies to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) grew from 5,503 to 48,562, an increase of 782 percent.1 As one of the responses to this growing threat, the executive branch of the US government has established as one of its cross agency priority (CAP) goals2 the continuous monitoring of federal information systems to enable departments and agencies to maintain an ongoing near-real-time awareness and assessment of information security risk and rapidly respond to support organizational risk management decisions. In November 2013, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued memorandum M-14-03 requiring all federal departments and agencies to establish an information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) program.3 The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been tasked to work with all of the departments and agencies to help them implement continuous monitoring through the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. To help it comply with the OMB mandate, one large US government agency has contracted with SuprTEK, an IT engineering and professional services firm, to develop a continuous monitoring system that is responsible for monitoring millions of devices across a globally distributed network. The system has enabled the client to improve its processes for risk and vulnerability management, certification and accreditation (C&A), compliance and reporting, and secure configuration management, greatly improving the security posture of its systems and saving countless work hours by automating many of the previously manual processes.},

As a consequence the products that need higher protection do not receive it, increasing risk. The threat-based definition proposed in this paper solves those problems by focusing attention on threats, thereby moving beyond compliance to risk management. (DoDI 8500.2 provides the definitions and controls that form the basis for IA across the DoD.) Familiarity with 8500.2 is assumed.},

abstract = {The Insider Threat Security Reference Architecture, ITSRA, provides an enterprise wide solution to insider threat. The architecture consists of four security layers - Business, Information, Data, and Application. Organizations should deploy and enforce controls at each layer in order to address insider attacks. Each layer does not function in isolation or independently of other layers. Rather, the correlation of indicators and application of controls across all four layers forms the crux of this approach. Based on empirical data consisting of over 600 cases of insider crimes, insider attacks proved successful in inflicting damage when an organization failed to implement adequate controls in any of three security principles - authorized access, acceptable use, and continuous monitoring. The ITSRA draws from existing best practices and standards as well as from analysis of these cases to provide actionable guidance for organizations to improve their posture against the insider threat.},

Hackers have found a new attack vector and are successfully exploiting it. Application exploits are to blame for this rise in security compromises and security professionals need to identify and secure the application. While risk cannot be completely eliminated, a strong Application Security Program can identify and mitigate these risks to a more manageable level. Organizational support, framework selection, and adherence to compliance and regulatory requirements are vital to the success of the program and the security of your applications. If you lack any of these elements the program will fail. There are many frameworks to choose from, so careful consideration must be taken to ensure the right framework is chosen for your organization. A successful Application Security Program will be fully integrated within the SDLC. It will enable your organization to identify and remediate risks with applications. If implanted and executed effectively it will also meet the requirements for FISMA compliance.},
