abstract = {File carving is a recovery technique allowing file recovery without knowledge about contextual information such as file system metadata. Due to recent advancements in research, file carving has become an essential technique for both general data recovery and digital forensics investigations. During the last few years a considerable amount of publications has been published on the topic of file carving. Out of around 130 publications in this field we selected 70 key papers with major contributions to the topic in order to identify potential fields of future research activities. The first contribution of this paper is a survey on state-of-the-art literature supporting researchers and practitioners in gaining a comprehensive view on the progress in file carving research. In addition to that, the second major contribution of this paper is a (preliminary) file carving ontology. The purpose of the ontology presented within this paper is to push forward recovery approaches that are based on knowledge bases processible by computer systems.},

abstract = {Digital forensics is an important field of cybersecurity and digital crimes investigation. It entails applying file recovery methods to analyze data from storage media and extract hidden, deleted or overwritten files. The recovery process might have accompanied with cases of unallocated partitions of blocks or clusters and the absence of file system metadata. These cases entail advance recovery methods that have carving abilities. The file carving methods include different types of techniques to identify, validate and reassemble the file. This paper presents a comprehensive study of data recovery, file carving, and file reassembling. It focuses on identifying and recovering JPEG Images as it is a wildly covered in the literature. It classifies the carving techniques into three types: signature-, structure-, and content-based carvers. Subsequently, the paper reviews seven advanced carving methods in the literature. Finally, the paper presents a number of research gaps and conclude a number of possible improvements. Generally, both the gaps and possible improvements are associated with the fragmentation problem of data files.},

Up to now, a multitude of research papers proposing new classification approaches have been published. Within this paper we comprehensively review existing classification approaches and classify them into categories. For each category, approaches are grouped based on shared commonalities. The major contribution of this paper is a novel taxonomy of existing data fragment classification approaches. We highlight progress made by previous work facilitating the identification of future research directions. Furthermore, the taxonomy can provide the foundation for future knowledge-based classification approaches.},

abstract = {During forensic examination, analysis of unallocated space of seized storage media is essential to extract the previously deleted or overwritten files when the file system metadata is missing or corrupted. The process of recovering files from the unallocated space based on file type-specific information (header and footer) and/or file contents is known as Data Carving. The research in this domain has witnessed various technological enhancements in terms of tools and techniques over the past years. This paper surveys various data carving techniques, in particular multimedia files and classifies the research in the domain into three categories: classical carving techniques, smart carving techniques and modern carving techniques. Further, seven popular multimedia carving tools are empirically evaluated. We conclude with the need to develop the new techniques in the field for carving multimedia files due to the fact that the fragmentation and compression are very common issues for these files.},

abstract = {Abstract. Reassembling fragmented image files plays a crucial role in seizing digital evidence from scattered digital image files. The existing algorithms are mainly graph based, which cast the reassembly problem as a K-vertex disjoint path problem in a directed complete graph, which is an NP-complete problem. Based on the padding bytes in BMP files, we present a method to exclude most impossible paths, which can improve the accuracy and decrease the time complexity of the existing graph-based methods. According to the alignment rule of BMP format, padding bytes must be appended to the end of each row to bring up the length of the row to a multiple of 4 bytes. Hence the fragment, being a vertex of the path which correctly reassembles a file, has a property; its byte values at padding positions must be the padding values. Only the fragments with such property can be candidate fragments for the vertex. On the test dataset which is constructed based on 330 image files, taking eight classical methods as examples, we show that the proposed method produces an accuracy improvement ranging from 32% to 55%, and reduces the run time to a scope from 1/6 to 1/237.},

abstract = {File carving is a common technique for retrieving evidence data from computers that 
have been used for crime activities to assist crimes investigations especially in solving 
pornography cases where traditional data recovery fail. However, carving fragmented 
JPEG files are not easy to solve due to the complexity of determining the fragmentation 
point. In this research, X_myKarve’s framework is introduced to address the 
fragmentation issues that occur in JPEG images. The framework consists of six steps 
namely, dataset acquisition and preparation, pre-processing, work instruction 
generation, image carving and reconstitution, image completeness validation and 
fragmentation handling. X_myKarve is extended using myKarve’s framework by 
introducing a new technique, deletion by binary search to detect fragmentation point 
which is used to separate a file into several individual fragments. These fragments are 
then reassembled with the correct pairs which form a complete and correct image. 
X_myKarve is tested using various datasets namely DFRWS 2006, DFRWS 2007 and 
additional datasets which are prepared and designed to simulate a particular 
fragmentation problems addressed in this research. The result shows that X_myKarve 
is capable of carving 23.8% more than myKarve and 45.4% more than RevIt for 
DFRWS 2006 datasets where X_myKarve can carve intertwined fragmented JPEG 
images completely compared to myKarve and RevIt. X_myKarve is a good alternative 
for carving more fragmented JPEG files that are intertwined with each other.},
